Couples		John Updike	3.58	4854	336	Couples is the book that has been assailed for its complete frankness &amp; praised as an artful, seductive, savagely graphic portrait of love, marriage &amp; adultery in America. But be it damned or hailed, Couples drew back the curtain forever on sex in suburbia in the late 20th century. A classic, it's one of those books that will be read &amp; remembered for a long time to come.	570	1968			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11662.Couples
