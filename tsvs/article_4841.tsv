The Rise of Nazil: Complete Epic Fantasy Trilogy: Gritty Epic Fantasy		Aaron-Michael Hall	4.18	268	6	INTERNATIONAL EPIC FANTASY AWARD-WINNERBefore Nazil’s rise...came its destruction.The liberation of a world ignited the Zon’tul demon’s hunger to consume it.The battles fought in The Rise of Nazil were the presage of an impending war. A war not for land, wealth, or power, but for the fate of the mortal world which hung tethered to a brittle filament, separating the Nether from the mortal. As the gods continued to weaken, the demons began their rise.What began with Mah’saahc’s awakening in Seed of Scorn, crept across Faélondul, devouring and possessing the souls of men, incessantly seeking the Blood of Oisin needed to breach the threshold between realms.The sacrifices and bonds that once held the Benoists’ together could be the catalyst which tears them apart. The darkness is coming, and once the sides are chosen, neither can win...without dying.If you love the intrigue and treachery of George R.R. Martin, the epic battles and characterization of R.A. Salvatore, and the exceptional world-building, politics, and magical systems of Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson, The Rise of Nazil trilogy will captivate you from start to finish.Step away from the ordinary and immerse yourself in a unique and enthralling diverse epic fantasy.Faélondul Awaits“The Rise of Nazil is an epic fantasy that should be shelved next to the works of R.A. Salvatore and J. R. R. Tolkien. This book was the best read of 2015.” -Mudville Dames“The Rise of Nazil is a complex work, with the violence, intricate treacheries, and modern sensibilities of The Game of Thrones.” -Amazon“This is the best epic fantasy trilogy I’ve read in over a decade. The plot twists, deep characters, amazing prose, superb dialogue, and worldbuilding are mere elements in the vast tapestry Hall creates. This trilogy defies categorization.”  -Amazon“This is a complex plot at its best. The character development is perfect.” -Readers’ Favorite Books by Aaron-Michael HallGritty Epic Fantasy:The Rise of Nazil ISeed of Scorn IIPiercing the Darkness IIIScience Fantasy:Rites of Heirdron IOrbs of Trenihgea IIEpic Fantasy:Kurintor NyusiTamesaComing SoonShadokyn: Blood of Oisin IKeepers of Nine	1549	March 29th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44679025-the-rise-of-nazil
