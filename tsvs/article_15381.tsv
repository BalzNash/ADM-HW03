The Picture of Dorian Gray and Other Fantastic Tales		Oscar Wilde	4.05	64	8	Horror hides behind an attractive face in The Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde's scandalous tale of a Victorian libertine and his life of evil excesses. Though Dorian's hedonistic indulgences leave no blemish on his ageless features, the painted portrait imbued with his soul proves a living catalogue of corruption, revealing in every new line and lesion it develops the manifold sins he has committed. Desperate to hide the physical evidence of his unregenerate spirit, Dorian will stop at nothing to keep his picture's existence a secret.The Picture of Dorian Gray and Other Fantastic Tales collects four of Wilde's tales of the macabre. Leavened with wit and written with the flare that was the hallmark of Wilde's style, they rank among the most sophisticated literary fantasies of the nineteenth century.Stories include: Lord Arthur Savile's CrimeThe Canterville GhostThe Sphinx Without a SecretPoems in Prose include:The ArtistThe Doer of GoodThe DiscipleThe MasterThe House of JudgementThe Teacher of Wisdom	360	August 10th 2010			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9401590-the-picture-of-dorian-gray-and-other-fantastic-tales
