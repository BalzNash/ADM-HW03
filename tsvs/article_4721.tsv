Kiss of the Spider Woman		Manuel Puig	3.98	12948	844	Sometimes they talk all night long. In the still darkness of their cell, Molina re-weaves the glittering and fragile stories of the film he loves, and the cynical Valentin listens. Valentin believes in the just cause which makes all suffering bearable; Molina believes in the magic of love which makes all else endurable. Each has always been alone, and always - especially now - in danger of betrayal. But in cell 7 each surrenders to the other something of himself that he has never surrendered before.	281	1976	Valent√≠n Arregui Paz, Luis Molina	Argentina Buenos Aires	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/588242.Kiss_of_the_Spider_Woman
