No Exit		Jean-Paul Sartre	4.15	27067	1250	"Jean-Paul Sartre, the great French existentialist, displays his mastery of drama in NO EXIT, an unforgettable portrayal of hell.The play is a depiction of the afterlife in which three deceased characters are punished by being locked into a room together for all eternity. It is the source of Sartre's especially famous and often misinterpreted quotation ""L'enfer, c'est les autres"" or ""Hell is other people"", a reference to Sartre's ideas about the Look and the perpetual ontological struggle of being caused to see oneself as an object in the world of another consciousness."	60	1947	Garcin, In√®s, Estelle	Hell	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123933.No_Exit
