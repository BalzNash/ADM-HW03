Death and the Maiden		Ariel Dorfman	3.96	3551	245	Ariel Dorfman's explosively provocative, award-winning drama is set in a country that has only recently returned to democracy. Gerardo Escobar has just been chosen to head the commission that will investigate the crimes of the old regime when his car breaks down and he is picked up by the humane doctor Roberto Miranda. But in the voice of this good Samaritan, Gerardo's wife, Paulina Salas, thinks she recognizes another manâ€”the one who raped and tortured her as she lay blindfolded in a military detention center years before.	96	1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/163330.Death_and_the_Maiden
