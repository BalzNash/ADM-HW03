Rules		Cynthia Lord	3.97	55354	4979	"Twelve-year-old Catherine just wants a normal life. Which is near impossible when you have a brother with autism and a family that revolves around his disability. She's spent years trying to teach David the rules-from ""a peach is not a funny-looking apple"" to ""keep your pants on in public""-in order to stop his embarrassing behaviors. But the summer Catherine meets Jason, a paraplegic boy, and Kristi, the next-door friend she's always wished for, it's her own shocking behavior that turns everything upside down and forces her to ask: What is normal?"	208	2006		Maine	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/222458.Rules
