The Culture of Critique: An Evolutionary Analysis of Jewish Involvement in Twentieth-Century Intellectual and Political Movements		Kevin B. MacDonald	4.29	456	50	MacDonald provides a theoretical analysis and review of data on the widespread tendency among Jewish-dominated intellectual movements to develop radical critiques of gentile culture. These movements are viewed as the outcome of the fact that Jews and gentiles have different interests in the construction of culture and in various public policy issues (e.g. immigration policy, Israel). Several of these Jewish movements attempt to combat anti-Semitism by advocating social categorization processes in which the Jew/gentile distinction is minimized in importance.Jewish policy was aimed at developing an America charcaterized by cultural pluralism and populated by groups of people from all parts of the world rather than by a homogeneous White Christian culture populated largely by people of European descent.	544	1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182136.The_Culture_of_Critique
