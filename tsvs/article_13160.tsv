The Road of the Dead		Kevin Brooks	3.81	2705	263	On a storm-ravaged night, a 19-year-old girl is kidnapped, raped, and killed. Three days later, her two younger brothers set out in search of her murderer. Cole, 17, is a dark-eyed devil who doesn't care if he lives or dies, while Ruben, 14, is a strange child who sometimes, inexplicably, experiences sensations above and beyond his own. This is the story of the boys' journey from their half-gypsy home on a London junk lot to the ghostly moors of Devon, where they hope and fear to find the truth about their sister's death. It's a long road, cold and hard and violent. It's THE ROAD OF THE DEAD.	368	February 13th 2006	Jess Delaney, Ruben Ford, Cole Ford, Rachel Ford, Abbie Gorman	Lychcombe, England Dartmoor, Devon, England Plymouth, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/601390.The_Road_of_the_Dead
