Runaway Horses	The Sea of Fertility #2	Yukio Mishima, Michael Gallagher	4.19	4987	352	Isao is a young, engaging patriot, and a fanatical believer in the ancient samurai ethos. He turns terrorist, organising a violent plot against the new industrialists, who he believes are threatening the integrity of Japan and usurping the Emperorâ€™s rightful power. As the conspiracy unfolds and unravels, Mishima brilliantly chronicles the conflicts of a decade that saw the fabric of Japanese life torn apart.	432	1969	Shigekuni Honda, Isao Iinuma, Shigeyuki Iinuma	Osaka	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62812.Runaway_Horses
