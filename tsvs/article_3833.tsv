The Power		Naomi Alderman	3.81	161024	18989	In The Power the world is a recognisable place: there's a rich Nigerian kid who lounges around the family pool; a foster girl whose religious parents hide their true nature; a local American politician; a tough London girl from a tricky family. But something vital has changed, causing their lives to converge with devastating effect. Teenage girls now have immense physical power - they can cause agonising pain and even death. And, with this small twist of nature, the world changes utterly.This extraordinary novel by Naomi Alderman, a Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year and Granta Best of British writer, is not only a gripping story of how the world would change if power was in the hands of women but also exposes, with breath-taking daring, our contemporary world.	341	October 27th 2016	"Roxy Monke, Allie Montgomery-Taylor (Mother Eve), Olatunde ""Tunde"" Edo, Margot Cleary, Jocelyn Cleary, Tatiana Moskalev, Darrell Monke"	Lagos Riyadh Manfouha Chișinău Delhi Tucson, Arizona Basarabeasca	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29751398-the-power
