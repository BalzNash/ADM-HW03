I Capture the Castle		Dodie Smith	4.00	85160	8538	Through six turbulent months of 1934, 17-year-old Cassandra Mortmain keeps a journal, filling three notebooks with sharply funny yet poignant entries about her home, a ruined Suffolk castle, and her eccentric and penniless family. By the time the last diary shuts, there have been great changes in the Mortmain household, not the least of which is that Cassandra is deeply, hopelessly, in love.	408	1948	Cassandra Mortmain, Rose Mortmain, James Mortmain, Topaz Mortmain, Thomas Mortmain, Stephen Colly, Simon Cotton, Neil Cotton, Miss Marcy, Audrey Fox-Cotton, Leda Fox-Cotton	Suffolk, England Godsend Castle, Suffolk, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31122.I_Capture_the_Castle
