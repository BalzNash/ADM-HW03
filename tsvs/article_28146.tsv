The Lives of a Cell: Notes of a Biology Watcher	Notes of a Biology Watcher #1	Lewis Thomas	4.15	9518	284	"Anticipates the kind of writing that will appear more frequently as scientists take on poetic language in order to communicate human truths too mysterious for old-fashioned commonsense. Elegant, suggestive &amp; clarifying, Thomas' humane vision explores the world &amp; examines the complex interdependence of all things. Extending beyond the usual limitations of biological science &amp; into a vast world of hidden relationships, this book explores in personal, poetic essays to topics such as computers, germs, language, music, death, insects &amp; medicine. He writes, ""Once you have become permanently startled, as I am, by the realization that we are a social species, you tend to keep an eye out for the pieces of evidence that this is, by &amp; large, good for us.""The lives of a cell Thoughts for a countdown On societies as organismsA fear of pheromones The music of This sphereAn earnest proposal The technology of medicineVibesCeti The long habit Antaeus in Manhattan The MBL Autonomy Organelles as organisms Germs Your very good healthSocial talk Information Death in the openNatural scienceNatural manThe Iks Computers The planning of scienceSome biomythologyOn various wordsLiving language On probability and possibilityThe world's biggest membraneReference Notes"	160	January 1st 1974			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/294368.The_Lives_of_a_Cell
