The Pickwick Papers		Charles Dickens	3.84	24576	1663	Few first novels have created as much popular excitement as The Pickwick Papers–-a comic masterpiece that catapulted its 24-year-old author to immediate fame. Readers were captivated by the adventures of the poet Snodgrass, the lover Tupman, the sportsman Winkle &amp;, above all, by that quintessentially English Quixote, Mr Pickwick, &amp; his cockney Sancho Panza, Sam Weller. From the hallowed turf of Dingley Dell Cricket Club to the unholy fracas of the Eatanswill election, via the Fleet debtor’s prison, characters &amp; incidents sprang to life from Dickens’s pen, to form an enduringly popular work of ebullient humour &amp; literary invention.	801	1837	Samuel Pickwick, Nathaniel Winkle, Augustus Snodgrass, Tracy Tupman, Sam Weller, Tony Weller, Alfred Jingle, Job Trotter, Mr. Wardle, Emily Wardle, Benjamin Allen, Arabella Allen, Bob Sawyer, Mr. Perker, Mrs. Bardell, Dr. Slammer, Solomon Pell, Rachael Wardle, Mr. Dodson, Mr. Fogg		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/229432.The_Pickwick_Papers
