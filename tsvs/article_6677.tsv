Nemesis	Miss Marple #12	Agatha Christie	3.86	26811	1378	In utter disbelief, Jane Marple read the letter addressed to her from the recently deceased Mr Rafiel - an acquaintance she had met briefly on her travels. He had left instructions for her to investigate a crime after his death. The only problem was, he had failed to tell her who was involved or where and when the crime had been committed. It was most intruguing. Soon she is faced with a new crime - the ultimate crime - murder. It seems someone is adamant that past evils remain buried...	213	1971	Mr. Rafiel, Miss Marple, Esther Walters, Michael Rafiel, Verity Hunt, Archbishop Brabazon, Elizabeth Temple (Nemesis), Miss Cooke, Lavinia Glynne, Clotilde Bradbury-Scott, Anthea Bradbury-Scott, Miss Barrow, Professor Wanstead, Emlyn Price, Nora Broad, Inspector Douglas	St. Mary Mead, England London, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31304.Nemesis
