Just Kids		Patti Smith	4.15	181191	11034	In Just Kids, Patti Smith's first book of prose, the legendary American artist offers a never-before-seen glimpse of her remarkable relationship with photographer Robert Mapplethorpe in the epochal days of New York City and the Chelsea Hotel in the late sixties and seventies. An honest and moving story of youth and friendship, Smith brings the same unique, lyrical quality to Just Kids as she has to the rest of her formidable body of work--from her influential 1975 album Horses to her visual art and poetry.	304	January 19th 2010	Patti Smith, Robert Mapplethorpe	New York State New York City, New York	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/341879.Just_Kids
