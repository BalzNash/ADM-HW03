Vox		Nicholson Baker	3.44	5437	494	"A man and a woman, strangers to each other, residents of distant cities, have both called an adult party line. Finding each other's voice attractive, they soon switch to a private, ""one-to-one"" connection. Their seduction-through-conversation begins hesitantly and then becomes erotic."	176	February 21st 1992			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28229.Vox
