The Shadow Man		John Katzenbach	3.81	4408	259	"In Berlin in 1943, he was known and dreaded as Der Schattenmann--a merciless ""catcher"" of Jews for the Nazis. Few saw his face and lived. In present-day Miami Beach, he has resurfaced--to silence forever the survivors who remember. Unless retired homicide detective Simon Winter can find him first."	437	1995		Miami Beach, Florida	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67933.The_Shadow_Man
