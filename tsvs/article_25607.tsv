Little Beach Street Bakery	Little Beach Street Bakery #1	Jenny Colgan	3.88	25890	2822	Amid the ruins of her latest relationship, Polly Waterford moves far away to the sleepy seaside resort of Polbearne, where she lives in a small, lonely flat above an abandoned shop.To distract her from her troubles, Polly throws herself into her favorite hobby: making bread. But her relaxing weekend diversion quickly develops into a passion. As she pours her emotions into kneading and pounding the dough, each loaf becomes better than the last. Soon, Polly is working her magic with nuts and seeds, olives and chorizo, and the local honey-courtesy of a handsome local beekeeper. Drawing on reserves of determination and creativity Polly never knew she had, she bakes and bakes . . . and discovers a bright new life where she least expected it.	416	March 13th 2014	"Polly Waterford, Cornelius ""Tarnie"" Tarnforth, Jayden, Gillian Manse, Huckle, Archie, Muriel, Kerensa, Reuben Finkle"	Cornwall, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18213783-little-beach-street-bakery
