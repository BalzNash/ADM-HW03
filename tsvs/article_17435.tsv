Dirty Work		Larry Brown	4.18	1657	165	Dirty Work is the story of two men, strangersâ€”one white, the other black. Both were born and raised in Mississippi. Both fought in Vietnam. Both were gravely wounded. Now, twenty-two years later, the two men lie in adjacent beds in a VA hospital.Over the course of a day and a night, Walter James and Braiden Chaney talk of memories, of passions, of fate. With great vision, humor, and courage, Brown writes mostly about love in a story about the waste of war.	247	March 30th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/377994.Dirty_Work
