What a Carve Up!	The Winshaw Legacy #1	Jonathan Coe	4.10	9420	635	If Charles Dickens and Agatha Christie had ever managed to collaborate, they might have produced this shamelessly entertaining novel, which introduces readers to what may be the most powerful family in England--and is certainly the vilest. A tour de force of menace, malicious comedy, and torrential social bile, this book marks the American debut of an extraordinary writer.	512	April 28th 1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/193873.What_a_Carve_Up_
