The Great Indian Novel		Shashi Tharoor	3.88	5816	447	In this award-winning, internationally acclaimed novel, Tharoor has masterfully recast the 2,000 year-old epic, The Mahabharata, with fictional but highly recognizable events and characters from twentieth-century Indian politics. Chronicling the Indian struggle for freedom and independence from Great Britain, Tharoor directs his hilarious satire as much against Indian foibles as the bumbling of the British rulers.	423	1989			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30843.The_Great_Indian_Novel
