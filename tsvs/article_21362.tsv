Close to the Knives: A Memoir of Disintegration		David Wojnarowicz	4.44	2308	208	"In Close to the Knives, David Wojnarowicz gives us an important and timely document: a collection of creative essays - a scathing, sexy, sublimely humorous and honest personal testimony to the ""Fear of Diversity in America."" From the author's violent childhood in suburbia to eventual homelessness on the streets and piers of New York City, to recognition as one of the most provocative artists of his generation -- Close to the Knives is his powerful and iconoclastic memoir. Street life, drugs, art and nature, family, AIDS, politics, friendship and acceptance: Wojnarowicz challenges us to examine our lives -- politically, socially, emotionally, and aesthetically."	288	May 7th 1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89213.Close_to_the_Knives
