Tales of Pirx the Pilot		Stanis≈Çaw Lem, Louis Iribarne	4.10	4976	140	In Pilot Pirx, Lem has created an irresistibly likable character: an astronaut who gives the impression of still navigating by the seat of his pants-a bumbler but an inspired one. By investing Pirx with a range of human foibles, Lem offers a wonderful vision of the audacity, childlike curiosity, and intuition that can give humans the courage to confront outer space. Translated by Louis Iribarne.A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book.	206	1961	Pirx		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28769.Tales_of_Pirx_the_Pilot
