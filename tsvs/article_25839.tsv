My Antonia	Great Plains Trilogy #3	Willa Cather, Alyssa  Harad	3.80	120376	7470	Through Jim Burden's endearing, smitten voice, we revisit the remarkable vicissitudes of immigrant life in the Nebraska heartland, with all its insistent bonds. Guiding the way are some of literature's most beguiling characters: the Russian brothers plagued by memories of a fateful sleigh ride, Antonia's desperately homesick father and self-indulgent mother, and the coy Lena Lingard. Holding the pastoral society's heart, of course, is the bewitching, free-spirited Antonia.	314	1918	Ántonia Shimerda, Jim Burden, Josiah Burden, Emmaline Burden, Ambrosch Shimerda, Lena Lingard, Otto Fuchs, Jake Marpole, Mr. Shimerda, Mrs. Shimerda	Nebraska	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17150.My_ntonia
