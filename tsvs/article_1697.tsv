The House on Mango Street		Sandra Cisneros	3.66	126670	10861	Acclaimed by critics, beloved by readers of all ages, taught everywhere from inner-city grade schools to universities across the country, and translated all over the world, The House on Mango Street is the remarkable story of Esperanza Cordero. Told in a series of vignettes – sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes deeply joyous–it is the story of a young Latina girl growing up in Chicago, inventing for herself who and what she will become. Few other books in our time have touched so many readers.	110	1984	Esperanza, Nenny	Chicago, Illinois	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139253.The_House_on_Mango_Street
