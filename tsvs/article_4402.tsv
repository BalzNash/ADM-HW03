""Dr. Seuss chronicles the feud between the Yooks and the Zooks from slingshots through sophisticated weaponry, until each side has the capacity to destroy the world. The language amuses, the drawings are zesty and humorous, and the demand for this book will be large.""-- ""School Library Journal."" ""Provocative, packs an allegorical punch. The parade of increasingly elaborate (and ridiculous) armaments makes a telling point.""-- ""Booklist."""	42	January 12th 1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/275325.The_Butter_Battle_Book
