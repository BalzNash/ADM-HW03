What They Always Tell Us		Martin  Wilson	3.93	4821	359	JAMES AND ALEX have barely anything in common anymoreâ€”least of all their experiences in high school, where James is a popular senior and Alex is suddenly an outcast. But at home, there is Henry, the precocious 10-year-old across the street, who eagerly befriends them both. And when Alex takes up running, there is James's friend Nathen, who unites the brothers in moving and unexpected ways.	293	August 12th 2008	Alex Jacobi, James Rasmussen	Alabama	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2498668.What_They_Always_Tell_Us
