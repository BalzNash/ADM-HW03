False Memory		Dean Koontz	3.88	44916	1260	It's a fear more paralyzing than falling. More terrifying than darkness. More horrifying than anything you can imagine. It's the one fear you cannot escape, no matter where you run... no matter where you hide. It's the fear of yourself. It's real. It can happen to you. And facing it can be deadly. Fear for your mind.	751	1999			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/182425.False_Memory
