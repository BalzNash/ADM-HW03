Lolita		Vladimir Nabokov, Craig Raine	3.89	666678	24880	Humbert Humbert - scholar, aesthete and romantic - has fallen completely and utterly in love with Lolita Haze, his landlady's gum-snapping, silky skinned twelve-year-old daughter. Reluctantly agreeing to marry Mrs Haze just to be close to Lolita, Humbert suffers greatly in the pursuit of romance; but when Lo herself starts looking for attention elsewhere, he will carry her off on a desperate cross-country misadventure, all in the name of Love. Hilarious, flamboyant, heart-breaking and full of ingenious word play, Lolita is an immaculate, unforgettable masterpiece of obsession, delusion and lust.	331	September 1955	Humbert Humbert, Dolores “Lolita” Haze, Charlotte Haze, Clare Quilty	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7604.Lolita
