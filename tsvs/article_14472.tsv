Layla and Majnun	شاهکارهای ادبیات فارسی #37	Nizami Ganjavi, Colin Turner	3.99	2889	292	"The text is a prose rendition of Nizami's 12th-century poetic masterpiece, in which he reshapes the legends of Majnun, the quintessential romantic fool, into a tale of the ideal lover. For the Sufis, Majnun represents the perfect devotee of the ""religion of the heart,"" and the story is an allegory of the soul's longing for God. This is a beautiful production, and it includes a final chapter newly translated from the Persian by Omid Safi and Zia Inayat Khan."	256	1188	Majnun, Laila, Layla	Iran, Islamic Republic of Persia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67397.Layla_and_Majnun
