Something I've Been Meaning to Tell You: 13 Stories		Alice Munro	4.10	3038	242	In the thirteen stories in her remarkable second collection, Alice Munro demonstrates the precise observation, straightforward prose style, and masterful technique that led no less a critic than John Updike to compare her to Chekhov. The sisters, mothers and daughters, aunts, grandmothers, and friends in these stories shimmer with hope and love, anger and reconciliation, as they contend with their histories and their present, and what they can see of the future.WINNER OF THE NOBEL PRIZE® IN LITERATURE 2013	246	1974			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14283.Something_I_ve_Been_Meaning_to_Tell_You
