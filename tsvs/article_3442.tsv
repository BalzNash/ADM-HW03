The Information		Martin Amis	3.51	6716	307	"Fame, envy, lust, violence, intrigues literary and criminal - they're all here in The Information. How does one writer hurt another writer? This is the question novelist Richard Tull mills over, for his friend Gwyn Barry has become a darling of book buyers, award committees, and TV interviewers, even as Tull himself sinks deeper into the sub-basement of literary failure. The only way out of this predicament, Tull believes, is to plot the demise of Barry.""With The Information, Amis delivers a portrait of middle-age realignment with more verbal felicity and unbridled reach than [anyone] since Tom Wolfe forged Bonfire of the Vanities.""Â—Houston Chronicle"	374	1995	Richard Tull, Gwyn Barry, Gina Tull, Lady Demeter de Rougemount, Steve Cousins, Gal Aplanalp	London, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/380017.The_Information
