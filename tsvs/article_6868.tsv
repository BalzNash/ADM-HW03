Without Fail	Jack Reacher #6	Lee Child, Dick Hill	4.15	87528	2504	Skilled, cautious, and anonymous, Jack Reacher is perfect for the job: to assassinate the vice president of the United States. Theoretically, of course. A female Secret Service agent wants Reacher to find the holes in her system, and fast - because a covert group already has the vice president in their sights. They've planned well. There's just one thing they didn't plan on: Reacher.	14	May 13th 2002	"Frances Neagley, Mary Ellen ""M.E."" Froelich, Brook Armstrong, Stuyvesant, Jack Reacher"	Washington, D.C.
