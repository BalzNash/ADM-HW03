The Sirens of Titan		Kurt Vonnegut Jr.	4.14	115856	4773	The Sirens of Titan is an outrageous romp through space, time, and morality. The richest, most depraved man on Earth, Malachi Constant, is offered a chance to take a space journey to distant worlds with a beautiful woman at his side. Of course there's a catch to the invitationâ€”and a prophetic vision about the purpose of human life that only Vonnegut has the courage to tell.	224	1959	Winston Niles Rumfoord, Malachi Constant (Unk), Salo, Boaz, Beatrice Rumfoord (Bee), Chrono, Stony Stevenson, Noel Constant, Ransom K.
