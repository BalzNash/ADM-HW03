Grave Sight	Harper Connelly #1	Charlaine Harris	3.86	61178	2579	Grave Sight (Harper Connelly Mysteries, Book 1)Harper Connelly has what you might call a strange job: she finds dead people. She can sense the final location of a person who's passed, and share their very last moment. The way Harper sees it, she's providing a service to the dead while bringing some closure to the living - but she's used to most people treating her like a blood-sucking leech. Traveling with her step-brother Tolliver as manager and sometime-bodyguard, she's become an expert at getting in, getting paid, and getting out fast. Because for the living it's always urgent - even if the dead can wait forever.	293	October 1st 2005	Harper Connelly, Tolliver Lang, Teenie, Dell, Hollis, Sybil Teague, Nelly	Sarne, Arkansas	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58077.Grave_Sight
