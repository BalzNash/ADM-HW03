Faith Abbot is a good Puritan woman, but the magic inside an opal necklace begins to torment her with lustful thoughts.  For years her heart and body have craved handsome James Parris, a man twelve years her junior, a man she thinks should be courting women his own age. But now the magic of a ghost trapped in a jewel breaks down all her inhibitions.  When she and James surrender to the fierce erotic tension that pulses between them, her heart fills with joy.
