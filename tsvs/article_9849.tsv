Madeline	Madeline	Ludwig Bemelmans	4.23	194419	2018	Madeline is one of the best-loved characters in children's literature. Set in picturesque Paris, this tale of a brave little girl's trip to the hospital was a Caldecott Honor Book in 1940 and has as much appeal today as it did then. The combination of a spirited heroine, timelessly appealing art, cheerful humor, and rhythmic text makes Madeline a perennial favorite with children of all ages.	44	1939	Madeline, Miss Clavel, Doctor Cohn	Paris	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/475339.Madeline
