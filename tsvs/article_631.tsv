The Killer Angels	The Civil War Trilogy #2	Michael Shaara	4.31	75603	4832	In the four most bloody and courageous days of our nation's history, two armies fought for two dreams. One dreamed of freedom, the other of a way of life. Far more than rifles and bullets were carried into battle. There were memories. There were promises. There was love. And far more than men fell on those Pennsylvania fields. Shattered futures, forgotten innocence, and crippled beauty were also the casualties of war. The Killer Angels is unique, sweeping, unforgettableâ€”a dramatic re-creation of the battleground for America's destiny.	345	1974	Robert E. Lee, George Pickett, James Longstreet, Joshua Chamberlain	Gettysburg, Pennsylvania Pennsylvania	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/682804.The_Killer_Angels
