The Myth of Sisyphus and Other Essays		Albert Camus, Justin O'Brien	4.21	41248	1239	One of the most influential works of this century, this is a crucial exposition of existentialist thought. Influenced by works such as Don Juan, and the novels of Kafka, these essays begin with a meditation on suicide: the question of living or not living in an absurd universe devoid of order or meaning. With lyric eloquence, Camus posits a way out of despair, reaffirming the value of personal existence, and the possibility of life lived with dignity and authenticity.	212	1942			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11987.The_Myth_of_Sisyphus_and_Other_Essays
