High-Rise		J.G. Ballard	3.61	25367	2343	"When a class war erupts inside a luxurious apartment block, modern elevators become violent battlegrounds and cocktail parties degenerate into marauding attacks on ""enemy"" floors. In this visionary tale, human society slips into violent reverse as once-peaceful residents, driven by primal urges, re-create a world ruled by the laws of the jungle."	208	November 1975	Robert Laing, Charlotte Melville, Richard Wilder, Anthony Royal, Helen Wilder, Anne Royal	London, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12331767-high-rise
