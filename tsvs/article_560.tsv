Cutting for Stone		Abraham   Verghese	4.29	338316	25580	A sweeping, emotionally riveting first novel - an enthralling family saga of Africa and America, doctors and patients, exile and home.Marion and Shiva Stone are twin brothers born of a secret union between a beautiful Indian nun and a brash British surgeon at a mission hospital in Addis Ababa. Orphaned by their mother’s death in childbirth and their father’s disappearance, bound together by a preternatural connection and a shared fascination with medicine, the twins come of age as Ethiopia hovers on the brink of revolution. Yet it will be love, not politics—their passion for the same woman—that will tear them apart and force Marion, fresh out of medical school, to flee his homeland. He makes his way to America, finding refuge in his work as an intern at an underfunded, overcrowded New York City hospital. When the past catches up to him—nearly destroying him—Marion must entrust his life to the two men he thought he trusted least in the world: the surgeon father who abandoned him and the brother who betrayed him.An unforgettable journey into one man’s remarkable life, and an epic story about the power, intimacy, and curious beauty of the work of healing others.(front flap)	541	2009	Thomas Stone, Sister Mary Joseph Praise, Marion Stone, Shiva Stone	Addis Ababa Madras Kochi Aden Djibouti Asmara Khartoum Nairobi New York City, New York Boston, Massachusetts Rome	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3591262-cutting-for-stone
