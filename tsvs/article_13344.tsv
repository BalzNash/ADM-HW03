Humility: The Journey Toward Holiness		Andrew   Murray	4.40	5360	479	"When Jesus ""made himself nothing...taking the nature of a servant,"" He modeled for all believers true humility. Andrew Murray calls this ""our true nobility"" and ""thedistinguishing feature of discipleship."" With insightful, penetrating clarity, Murray calls all Christians to turn from pride, empty themselves, and study the character of Christ to be filled with His grace. Often called the best work on humility ever written, this edition has been edited for today's reader."	112	March 9th 1895			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/770265.Humility
