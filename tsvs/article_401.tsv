Doctor Zhivago		Boris Pasternak, John Bayley, Max Hayward, Manya Harari	4.01	83380	3191	This epic tale about the effects of the Russian Revolution and its aftermath on a bourgeois family was not published in the Soviet Union until 1987. One of the results of its publication in the West was Pasternak's complete rejection by Soviet authorities; when he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1958 he was compelled to decline it. The book quickly became an international best-seller.Dr. Yury Zhivago, Pasternak's alter ego, is a poet, philosopher, and physician whose life is disrupted by the war and by his love for Lara, the wife of a revolutionary. His artistic nature makes him vulnerable to the brutality and harshness of the Bolsheviks. The poems he writes constitute some of the most beautiful writing featured in the novel.	592	November 1957	Yury Andreyevich Zhivago, Alexander Alexandrovich Gromeko, Markel Shchapov, Pavel Pavlovich Antipov, Rodyon Fyodorovich Guishar, Victor Ippolitovich Komarovsky, Kologrivov, Kuprik Tiverzin, Iosif Gimazetdinovich Galiullin, Nikolay Nikolayevich Vedenyapin, Nicky Dudorov, Misha Gordon, Antonina Alexandrovna Gromeko, Anna Ivanovna Gromeko, Amalia Karlovna Guishar, Larissa Fëdorovna Antipova, Anfim Yefimovitch Samdevyatov, Nadya Kologrigova, Evgraf Andreevič Zivago, Marina (Doctor Zhivago)	Moscow Yuriatin Russia Siberia Soviet Union	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/130440.Doctor_Zhivago
