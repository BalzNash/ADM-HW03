Pet Sematary		Stephen King	4.00	428893	14291	'This is an alternate Cover Edition for ASIN: B00K3NEE56. When the Creeds move into a beautiful old house in rural Maine, it all seems too good to be true: physician father, beautiful wife, charming little daughter, adorable infant son-and now an idyllic home. As a family, they've got it all...right down to the friendly car. But the nearby woods hide a blood-chilling truth-more terrifying than death itself-and hideously more powerful. The Creeds are going to learn that sometimes dead is better.	580	November 14th 1983	Louis Creed, Ellie Creed, Gage Creed, Jud Crandall, Victor Pascow, Rachel Creed	Ludlow, Maine Maine	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33124137-pet-sematary
