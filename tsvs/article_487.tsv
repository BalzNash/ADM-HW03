Me Talk Pretty One Day		David Sedaris	3.99	620738	17425	David Sedaris' move to Paris from New York inspired these hilarious pieces, including the title essay, about his attempts to learn French from a sadistic teacher who declares that every day spent with you is like having a caesarean section. His family is another inspiration. You Can't Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother, who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers of food and cashiers with six-inch fingernails.	272	May 2nd 2000	David Sedaris	Paris Raleigh, North Carolina New York City, New York	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4137.Me_Talk_Pretty_One_Day
