Still Life with Woodpecker		Tom Robbins	4.03	74162	2817	Still Life with Woodpecker is a sort of a love story that takes place inside a pack of Camel cigarettes. It reveals the purpose of the moon, explains the difference between criminals and outlaws, examines the conflict between social activism and romantic individualism, and paints a portrait of contemporary society that includes powerful Arabs, exiled royalty, and pregnant cheerleaders. It also deals with the problem of redheads.	288	October 1980		Hawaii Seattle, Washington	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9566.Still_Life_with_Woodpecker
