The Golden Days	The Story of the Stone #1	Cao Xueqin, David Hawkes	4.22	1644	168	"""The Story of the Stone"" (c. 1760) is one of the greatest novels of Chinese literature. The first part of the story, The Golden Days, begins the tale of Bao-yu, a gentle young boy who prefers girls to Confucian studies, and his two cousins: Bao-chai, his parents' choice of a wife for him, and the ethereal beauty Dai-yu. Through the changing fortunes of the Jia family, this rich, magical work sets worldly events - love affairs, sibling rivalries, political intrigues, even murder - within the context of the Buddhist understanding that earthly existence is an illusion and karma determines the shape of our lives."	542	January 1st 1791			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/139874.The_Golden_Days
