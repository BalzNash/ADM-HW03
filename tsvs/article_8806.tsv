The Light of Other Days		Arthur C. Clarke, Stephen Baxter	3.99	6485	331	When a brilliant, driven industrialist harnesses the cutting edge of quantum physics to enable people everywhere, at trivial cost, to see one another at all times: around every corner, through every wall, into everyone's most private, hidden, and even intimate moments. It amounts to the sudden and complete abolition of human privacy--forever. Then, as society reels, the same technology proves able to look backwards in time as well. What happens next is a story only Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter could tell. The Light of Other Days is a novel that will change your view of what it is to be human.	384	April 16th 2000		Seattle, Washington	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/823062.The_Light_of_Other_Days
