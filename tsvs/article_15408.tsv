The Girl Who Speaks Bear		Sophie   Anderson	4.34	1577	281	Found abandoned in a bear cave as a baby, 12-year-old Yanka has always felt out of place in her small village. When she wakes up to find that her legs have become bear legs, she sets off into the forest to discover who she is, on a journey that takes her from icy rivers to smouldering mountains, with an ever-growing group of misfits alongside her... Interwoven with traditional stories of bears, princesses and dragons, Yanka's journey is a gorgeously lyrical adventure from the best-selling author of The House With Chicken Legs.	416	September 5th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43893965-the-girl-who-speaks-bear
