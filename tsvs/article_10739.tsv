Three Guineas		Virginia Woolf, Mark Hussey, Jane Marcus	3.88	3292	229	The author received three separate requests for a gift of one guinea-one for a women’s college building fund, one for a society promoting the employment of professional women, and one to help prevent war and “protect culture, and intellectual liberty.” This book is a threefold answer to these requests-and a statement of feminine purpose.	352	June 1938			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18854.Three_Guineas
