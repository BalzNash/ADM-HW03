Hallucinating Foucault		Patricia Duncker	3.99	1769	155	An intricate and self-reflective novel about that most delicate of relationships--meaning the one between writers and readers. The narrator, an anonymous graduate student, sets off on the trail of a French novelist named Paul Michel, who is currently confined to an asylum. Engineering his hero's release, the narrator finds himself enmeshed in bizarre love triangle, of which the three vertices are himself, the novelist, and the late Michel Foucault. Sex, it seems, can be made safe, but the oddball intimacy of reading cannot.	192	1996		Cambridge, England Paris Clermont-Ferrand	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/218859.Hallucinating_Foucault
