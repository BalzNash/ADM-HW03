The Other Woman	Gabriel Allon #18	Daniel Silva	4.08	23685	1791	She was his best-kept secret …In an isolated village in the mountains of Andalusia, a mysterious Frenchwoman begins work on a dangerous memoir. It is the story of a man she once loved in the Beirut of old, and a child taken from her in treason’s name. The woman is the keeper of the Kremlin’s most closely guarded secret. Long ago, the KGB inserted a mole into the heart of the West—a mole who stands on the doorstep of ultimate power.Only one man can unravel the conspiracy: Gabriel Allon, the legendary art restorer and assassin who serves as the chief of Israel’s vaunted secret intelligence service. Gabriel has battled the dark forces of the new Russia before, at great personal cost. Now he and the Russians will engage in a final epic showdown, with the fate of the postwar global order hanging in the balance.Gabriel is lured into the hunt for the traitor after his most important asset inside Russian intelligence is brutally assassinated while trying to defect in Vienna. His quest for the truth will lead him backward in time, to the twentieth century’s greatest act of treason, and, finally, to a spellbinding climax along the banks of the Potomac River outside Washington that will leave readers breathless.	496	July 17th 2018	Gabriel Allon, Chiara Zolli Allon, Eli Lavon, Adrian Carter, Kim Philby, Graham Seymour, Alistair Hughes, Rebecca Manning, Konstantin Kirov, Ari Shamron, Morris Payne, Eva Fernandes, Charlotte Bettencourt, Christopher Keller, Uzi Navot, Werner Schwarz, Sergei Morosov, Mikhail Abramov, Yossi Gavish, Dmitri Sokolov, Helen Seymour, Rimona Stern, Christoph Bittel, Nigel Whitcombe, Dina Sarid, Melinda Hughes, Yaakov Rossman, Alois Graf, Fareed Barakat	Washington, DC Tel Aviv London, England Seville Vienna Jerusalem Hampshire, England Andalusia Israel Bern Spain England Strasbourg Austria Montreal, Quebec (Montréal, Québec) Dartmoor, Devon, England Switzerland Budapest	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36421604-the-other-woman
