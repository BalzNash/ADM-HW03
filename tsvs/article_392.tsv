The English Patient		Michael Ondaatje	3.87	113977	4700	With ravishing beauty and unsettling intelligence, Michael Ondaatje's Booker Prize-winning novel traces the intersection of four damaged lives in an Italian villa at the end of World War II. Hana, the exhausted nurse; the maimed thief, Caravaggio; the wary sapper, Kip: each is haunted by the riddle of the English patient, the nameless, burned man who lies in an upstairs room and whose memories of passion, betrayal, and rescue illuminate this book like flashes of heat lightning.	320	September 1992	Kip, Hana, Geoffrey Clifton, Katharine Clifton, David Caravaggio, Ladislaus de Alm√°sy, Gyges of Lydia, Candaules of Lydia	Italy North Africa Sahara Desert Tuscany Fiesole, Tuscany Cairo Florence	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11713.The_English_Patient
