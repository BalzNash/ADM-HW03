The Book of Laughter and Forgetting		Milan Kundera, Aaron Asher, Serena Vitale	3.99	40813	2026	Rich in its stories, characters, and imaginative range, The Book of Laughter and Forgetting is the novel that brought Milan Kundera his first big international success in the late 1970's. Like all his work, it is valuable for far more than just its historical implications. In seven wonderfully integrated parts, different aspects of human existence are magnified and reduced, reordered and emphasized, newly examined, analyzed and experienced.	313	1979	Mirek, Znedna, Tamina	Prague (Praha)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240976.The_Book_of_Laughter_and_Forgetting
