A Farewell to Arms		Ernest Hemingway	3.81	264420	9721	A Farewell to Arms is the unforgettable story of an American ambulance driver on the Italian front and his passion for a beautiful English nurse. Set against the looming horrors of the battlefield - the weary, demoralized men marching in the rain during the German attack on Caporetto; the profound struggle between loyalty and desertionâ€”this gripping, semiautobiographical work captures the harsh realities of war and the pain of lovers caught in its inexorable sweep. Ernest Hemingway famously said that he rewrote his ending to A Farewell to Arms thirty-nine times to get the words right.	293	1929	Frederic Henry, Catherine Barkley, Rinaldi	Italy Milan Switzerland	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10799.A_Farewell_to_Arms
