The Physician	Cole Family Trilogy #1	Noah Gordon	4.37	38897	2078	In the 11th century, Rob Cole left poor, disease-ridden London to make his way across the land, hustling, juggling, peddling cures to the sick—and discovering the mystical ways of healing. It was on his travels that he found his own very real gift for healing—a gift that urged him on to become a doctor. So all consuming was his dream, that he made the perilous, unheard-of journey to Persia, to its Arab universities where he would undertake a transformation that would shape his destiny forever.	714	August 7th 1986		London, England Matlock Persia Constantinople	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4692.The_Physician
