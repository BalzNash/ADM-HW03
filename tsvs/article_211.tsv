The Night Circus		Erin Morgenstern	4.03	691734	73947	The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway—a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands. True love or not, the game must play out, and the fates of everyone involved, from the cast of extraordinary circus performers to the patrons, hang in the balance, suspended as precariously as the daring acrobats overhead. Written in rich, seductive prose, this spell-casting novel is a feast for the senses and the heart.	391	September 13th 2011	"Celia Bowen, Marco Alisdair, Isobel Martin, Penelope ""Poppet"" Aislin Murray, Winston ""Widget"" Aidan Murray, Bailey Clarke, Alexander H., Hector Bowen, Chandresh Christophe Lefevre, Friedrick Stefan Thiessen, Ethan Barris, Tara Burgess, Lainie Burgess, Tante Padva, Tsukiko"	New York City, New York Concord, Massachusetts London, England Dublin Boston, Massachusetts Montreal, Quebec (Montréal, Québec) Paris Basel Munich (München) Glasgow, Scotland Lyon Cairo Vienna Constantinople Prague (Praha)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9361589-the-night-circus
