Prom Nights from Hell	Short Stories from Hell	Meg Cabot, Kim Harrison, Michele Jaffe, Stephenie Meyer, Lauren Myracle	3.27	18582	1237	In this exciting collection, bestselling authors Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Kim Harrison (A Fistful of Charms), Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty), Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), and Lauren Myracle (ttyl) take bad prom nights to a whole new level--a paranormally bad level. Wardrobe malfunctions and two left feet don't hold a candle to discovering your date is the Grim Reaper--and he isn't here to tell you how hot you look. From angels fighting demons to a creepy take on getting what you wish for, these five stories will entertain better than any DJ in a bad tux. No corsage or limo rental necessary. Just good, scary fun.	304	April 24th 2007	Madison Avery, Josh Daniels, Seth (Kairos)		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/557332.Prom_Nights_from_Hell
