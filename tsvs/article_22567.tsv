The Windflower		Laura London, Sharon Curtis, Tom Curtis	4.05	1921	284	SHE LONGED FOR A PIRATE'S KISSES, FOR A GOLDEN ROGUE'S CARESS...Every lady of breeding knows. No one has a good time on a pirate ship. No one, that is, but the pirates. Yet there she was, Merry Wilding - kidnapped in error, taken from a ship bound from New York to England, spirited away in a barrel and swept aboard the infamous Black Joke....There she was, trembling with pleasure in the arms of her achingly handsome, sensationally sensual, golden-haired captor - Devon. From the storm-tossed Atlantic to the languid waters of the Gulf Stream, from a smuggler's den to a gilded mansion, Merry struggled to escape...to escape the prison of her own reckless passions, the bondage of sweet, bold desire...	530	May 1st 1984	Merri Wilding, Devon Crandall	Fairfield, Virginia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/679702.The_Windflower
