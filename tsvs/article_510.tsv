Of Human Bondage		W. Somerset Maugham, Benjamin DeMott, Maeve Binchy	4.10	50657	3225	From a tormented orphan with a clubfoot, Philip Carey grows into an impressionable young man with a voracious appetite for adventure and knowledge. His cravings take him to Paris at age eighteen to try his hand at art, then back to London to study medicine. But even so, nothing can sate his nagging hunger for experience. Then he falls obsessively in love, embarking on a disastrous relationship that will change his life forever.…Marked by countless similarities to Maugham’s own life, his masterpiece is “not an autobiography,” as the author himself once contended, “but an autobiographical novel; fact and fiction are inexorably mingled; the emotions are my own.”	684	1915	Philip Carey, Mildred Rogers, Norah Nesbit, Thorpe Athelny, Sally Athelny, Hayward, Emily Wilkinson, Louisa Carey, Dr. South, Harry Griffiths, Fanny Price (Of Human Bondage), Frederick Lawson, Cronshaw, Ruth Chalice, Dr. Tyrell, Betty Athelny	Blackstable, Kent, England Heidelberg Paris London, England England Brighton and Hove, Sussex, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31548.Of_Human_Bondage
