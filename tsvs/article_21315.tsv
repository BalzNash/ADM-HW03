The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War		David Halberstam	4.22	6914	726	"""In a grand gesture of reclamation &amp; remembrance, Mr Halberstam has brought the war back home.""--NY Times Halberstam's magisterial &amp; thrilling The Best &amp; the Brightest was a defining book about the Vietnam conflict. More than three decades later, he used his research &amp; journalistic skills to shed light on another pivotal moment in our history: the Korean War. He considered The Coldest Winter his most accomplished work, the culmination of 45 years of writing about America's postwar foreign policy. He gives a masterful narrative of the political decisions &amp; miscalculations on both sides. He charts the disastrous path that led to the massive entry of Chinese forces near the Yalu River &amp; that caught Douglas MacArthur &amp; his soldiers by surprise. He provides vivid &amp; nuanced portraits of all the major figures-Eisenhower, Truman, Acheson, Kim, &amp; Mao, &amp; Generals MacArthur, Almond &amp; Ridgway. At the same time, he provides us with his trademark highly evocative narrative journalism, chronicling the crucial battles with reportage of the highest order. As ever, he was concerned with the extraordinary courage &amp; resolve of people asked to bear an extraordinary burden. The Coldest Winter is contemporary history in its most literary &amp; luminescent form, providing crucial perspective on every war America has been involved in since. It's a book that Halberstam first decided to write over 30 years ago that took him nearly a decade to complete. It stands as a lasting testament to one of the greatest journalists &amp; historians of our time, &amp; to the fighting men whose heroism it chronicles."	734	January 1st 2007		Korean War	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/448135.The_Coldest_Winter
