Cold Mountain		Charles Frazier	3.87	222225	5734	Cold Mountain is a novel about a soldier’s perilous journey back to his beloved near the Civil War's end. At once a love story &amp; a harrowing account of one man’s long walk home, Cold Mountain introduces a new talent in American literature.Based on local history &amp; family stories passed down by Frazier’s great-great-grandfather, Cold Mountain is the tale of a wounded Confederate soldier, Inman, who walks away from the ravages of the war &amp; back home to his prewar sweetheart, Ada. His odyssey thru the devastated landscape of the soon-to-be-defeated South interweaves with Ada’s struggle to revive her father’s farm, with the help of an intrepid young drifter named Ruby. As their long-separated lives begin to converge at the close of the war, Inman &amp; Ada confront the vastly transformed world they’ve been delivered.Frazier reveals insight into human relations with the land &amp; the dangers of solitude. He also shares with the great 19th century novelists a keen observation of a society undergoing change. Cold Mountain recreates a world gone by that speaks to our time.	356	January 1st 1997		United States of America North Carolina Virginia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10920.Cold_Mountain
