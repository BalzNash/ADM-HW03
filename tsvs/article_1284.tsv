Narcissus and Goldmund		Hermann Hesse, Ursule Molinaro	4.21	45691	2014	Narcissus and Goldmund tells the story of two medieval men whose characters are diametrically opposite: Narcissus, an ascetic monk firm in his religious commitment, and Goldmund, a romantic youth hungry for knowledge and worldly experience. First published in 1930, Hesse's novel remains a moving and pointed exploration of the conflict between the life of the spirit and the life of the flesh. It is a theme that transcends all time.	320	1930		Mariabronn	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5954.Narcissus_and_Goldmund
