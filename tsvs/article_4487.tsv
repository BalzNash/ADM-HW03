Time Regained	Ã€ la recherche du temps perdu #7	Marcel Proust, Terence Kilmartin, Andreas Mayor, D.J. Enright	4.49	5175	514	The final volume of In Search of Lost Time chronicles the years of World War I, when, as M. de Charlus reflects on a moonlit walk, Paris threatens to become another Pompeii. Years later, after the war's end, Proust's narrator returns to Paris, where Mme. Verdurin has become the Princesse de Guermantes. He reflects on time, reality, jealousy, artistic creation, and the raw material for literature-his past life. This volume also includes the indispensable Guide to Proust, an index to all six volumes of the novel.	784	1927		Paris	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28405.Time_Regained
