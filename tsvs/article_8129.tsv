The Fall of the House of Usher		Edgar Allan Poe	3.94	44697	1413	"Dive into this classic from the singular mind of Edgar Allan Poe, who is widely regarded as the master of short horror fiction. ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" recounts the terrible events that befall the last remaining members of the once-illustrious Usher clan before it is -- quite literally -- rent asunder. With amazing economy, Poe plunges the reader into a state of deliciously agonizing suspense. It's a must-read for fans of the golden era of horror writing."	36	September 1st 1839	Madeline Usher, Roderick Usher, the Narrator (The Fall of the House of Usher), The servant, the valet, and the doctor	somewhere in the United States	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175516.The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Usher
