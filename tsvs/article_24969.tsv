Achilles in Vietnam: Combat Trauma and the Undoing of Character		Jonathan Shay	4.26	1306	121	In this strikingly original and groundbreaking book, Dr. Shay examines the psychological devastation of war by comparing the soldiers of Homer's Iliad with Vietnam veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Although the Iliad was written twenty-seven centuries ago it has much to teach about combat trauma, as do the more recent, compelling voices and experiences of Vietnam vets.	272	1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6069.Achilles_in_Vietnam
