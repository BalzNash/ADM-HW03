Half of a Yellow Sun		Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie	4.32	105310	8703	With effortless grace, celebrated author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie illuminates a seminal moment in modern African history: Biafra's impassioned struggle to establish an independent republic in southeastern Nigeria during the late 1960s. We experience this tumultuous decade alongside five unforgettable characters: Ugwu, a thirteen-year-old houseboy who works for Odenigbo, a university professor full of revolutionary zeal; Olanna, the professor’s beautiful young mistress who has abandoned her life in Lagos for a dusty town and her lover’s charm; and Richard, a shy young Englishman infatuated with Olanna’s willful twin sister Kainene. Half of a Yellow Sun is a tremendously evocative novel of the promise, hope, and disappointment of the Biafran war.	448	September 12th 2006	Ugwu, Olanna, Odenigbo, Kainene	Nigeria Biafra Nsukka Lagos Kano Port Harcourt Abba, Imo Umuahia Orlu	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18749.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun
