Beautiful Losers		Leonard Cohen	3.61	5907	455	One of the best-known experimental novels of the 1960s, Beautiful Losers is Cohen’ s most defiant and uninhibited work. The novel centres upon the hapless members of a love triangle united by their sexual obsessions and by their fascination with Catherine Tekakwitha, the 17th-century Mohawk saint. By turns vulgar, rhapsodic, and viciously witty, Beautiful Losers explores each character’s attainment of a state of self-abandonment, in which the sensualist cannot be distinguished from the saint.	243	1966		Montreal, Quebec (Montréal, Québec)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102908.Beautiful_Losers
