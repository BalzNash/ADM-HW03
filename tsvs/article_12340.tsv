The Summer of Skinny Dipping	Summer #1	Amanda Howells	3.80	7642	584	There Are Some Summers You'll Always RememberSometimes I wake up shivering in the early hours of the morning, drowning in dreams of being out there in the ocean that summer, of looking up at the moon and feeling as invisible and free as a fish. But I'm jumping ahead, and to tell the story right I have to go back to the beginning. To a place called Indigo Beach. To a boy with pale skin that glowed against the dark waves. To the start of something neither of us could have predicted, and which would mark us forever, making everything that came after and before seem like it belonged to another life.My name is Mia Gordon: I was sixteen years old, and I remember everything	295	June 1st 2010		The Hamptons, New York New York State	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7187640-the-summer-of-skinny-dipping
