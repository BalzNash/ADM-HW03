The Pursuit of Holiness		Jerry Bridges, Foster W. Cline, Jim Fay	4.32	19029	461	"""Be holy, for I am holy"" commands God to His people. But holiness is something that is often missed in the Christian's daily life. According to author Jerry Bridges, that's because we're not exactly sure what our part in holiness is. In The Pursuit of Holiness, he helps us see clearly just what we should rely on God to do--and what we should accept responsibility for ourselves."	160	1978			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/260791.The_Pursuit_of_Holiness
