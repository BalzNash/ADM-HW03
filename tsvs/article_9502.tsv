My Side of the Mountain Trilogy	Mountain #1-3	Jean Craighead George	4.15	3922	357	In 1959, Jean Craighead George published My Side of the Mountain. This coming-of-age story about a boy and his falcon went on to win a Newbery Honor, and for the past forty years has enthralled and entertained generations of would-be Sam Gribleys. The two books that followed--On the Far Side of the Mountain and Frightful's Mountain--were equally extraordinary. Now all three books are available in one deluxe yet affordable volume for veteran devotees and brand-new fans alike.	640	1988			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41668.My_Side_of_the_Mountain_Trilogy
