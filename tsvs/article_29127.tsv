Detectives in Togas	Detectives in Togas #1	Henry Winterfeld, Richard Winston, Clara Winston, Charlotte Kleinert	3.91	5473	259	In these two delightful history-mysteries, seven boys in Ancient Rome solve strange crimes . . . thanks to some help from their cranky teacher, a little bit of logic, and a lot of amusing misadventure.Yes, Rufus wrote CAIUS IS A DUMBBELL on his tablet at school, but no, he did not break into the schoolroom, did not tie up his teacher, and certainly did not paint his slur about Caius on the Temple of Minerva (even if it is in Rufus's own handwriting). Rufus is doomed unless his six classmates can find out who is really responsible. Every hour seems to bring a new, confusing clue . . . until the boys finally stumble upon someone who is not what he appears to be.	249	March 28th 1956		Rome	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/859358.Detectives_in_Togas
