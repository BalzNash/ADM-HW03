Ask For It	Georgian #1	Sylvia Day	3.75	8101	471	Series: Georgian, Book 1Length: 9 hrs and 31 minsNothing incites Marcus more than the primal hunger roused by his former fiancée, Elizabeth. It’s been years since she jilted him for another man, but that only means there’s a lot to catch up on, a lot to make up for, and that he’s going to enjoy every sweet moment.… The same drive and passion that sent her into another man’s arms is what brings Elizabeth back to Marcus. Her attraction to him is the one thing she fears, but she’s run out of options. Resisting is impossible. But does she have the courage to surrender everything?©2012 Sylvia Day (P)2012 Brilliance Audio, Inc.	320	2006	Marcus Ashford, Lady Elizabeth Hawthorne	London, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15774784-ask-for-it
