Darkly Dreaming Dexter	Dexter #1	Jeff Lindsay	3.89	191232	6478	Meet Dexter Morgan, a polite wolf in sheep's clothing. He's handsome and charming, but something in his past has made him abide by a different set of rules. He's a serial killer whose one golden rule makes him immensely likeable: he only kills bad people. And his job as a blood splatter expert for the Miami police department puts him in the perfect position to identify his victims. But when a series of brutal murders bearing a striking similarity to his own style start turning up, Dexter is caught between being flattered and being frightened—of himself or some other fiend.	288	July 10th 2004	Harry Morgan, Deborah Morgan, Sergeant James Doakes, Rita Morgan, Brian Moser, Vince Masuka, Lieutenant María LaGuerta, Angel Batista, Dexter Morgan, Joey Quinn, Tom Matthews, Jamie Batista	Miami, Florida Florida	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17231.Darkly_Dreaming_Dexter
