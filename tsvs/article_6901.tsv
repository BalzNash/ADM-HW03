Somehow they’ve muddled through, but since he’s totally devoted to the Kid, Bear isn’t actually doing much living. With a few exceptions, he’s retreated from the world, and he’s mostly okay with that - until Otter comes home.Otter is Bear’s best friend’s older brother, and as they’ve done for their whole lives, Bear and Otter crash and collide in ways neither expect. This time, though, there’s nowhere to run from the depth of emotion between them. Bear still believes his place is as the Kid’s guardian, but he can’t help thinking there could be something more for him in the world ... something or someone.	350	August 11th 2011	"Tyson ""Kid"" James Thompson, Derrick ""Bear"" McKenna, Oliver ""Otter"" Thompson"	Seafare, Oregon Oregon	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12156759-bear-otter-and-the-kid
