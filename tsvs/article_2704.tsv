The Leopard		Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, Archibald Colquhoun	4.01	24482	1871	The Leopard is a story of a decadent and dying aristocracy threatened by the forces of revolution and democracy. Set against the political upheavals of Italy in the 1860s, it focuses on Don Fabrizio, a Sicilian prince of immense sensual appetites, wealth, and great personal magnetism. Around this powerful figure swirls a glittering array of characters: a Bourbon king, liberals and pseudo liberals, peasants and millionaires.	319	October 25th 1958	Fabrizio Corbera, Principe di Salina, Tancredi Falconeri, Angelica Sed√†ra, Francesco Paolo Corbera, Concetta Corbera	Sicily	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/625094.The_Leopard
