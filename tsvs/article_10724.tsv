Crocodile Tears	Alex Rider #8	Anthony Horowitz	4.19	29125	887	It's just another day in the life of an average kid. If you're Alex Rider, that is. A con artist has realized there is big money in charity: the bigger the disaster, the greater the money flow! So that is what he will produce: the biggest disaster known to man, all thanks to genetically modified corn that can release a virus so potent it can knock out an entire country in one windy day. But Alex Rider will face whatever it takes - gunfire, explosions, hand-to-hand combat with mercenaries - to bring down his most dangerous adversary yet.Often imitated, never equaled, the series that triggered a reading phenomenon is back, exhilarating and addictive as ever.	385	November 1st 2009	Alex Rider, Alan Blunt, Jack Starbright, Smithers, Desmond McCain, Mrs Jones, Sabina Pleasure	London, England Scotland Kenya	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6566616-crocodile-tears
