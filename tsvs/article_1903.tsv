A Wild Sheep Chase	The Rat #3	Haruki Murakami, Alfred Birnbaum	3.94	93542	4720	His life was like a recurring nightmare: a train to nowhere. But an ordinary life has a way of taking an extraordinary turn. Add a girl whose ears are so exquisite that, when uncovered, they improve sex a thousand-fold, a runaway friend, a right-wing politico, an ovine-obsessed professor and a manic-depressive in a sheep outfit, implicate them in a hunt for a sheep, that may or may not be running the world, and the upshot is another singular masterpiece from Japan's finest novelist.	353	October 13th 1982		Tokyo Sapporo Hokkaido Junitaki	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11298.A_Wild_Sheep_Chase
