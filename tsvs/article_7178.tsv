Starring Sally J. Freedman as Herself		Judy Blume	3.93	13949	462	It's 1947, and Sally J. Freedman is full of wild ideas. She's got her eye on handsome Peter Horstein, the Latin lover of her dreams . . . on old Mr. Zavodsky, who looks suspiciously like Hitler in disguise . . . and on her father, who Sally misses terribly. There are so many things to worry and wonder about--but what ever happens, Sally's school year will certainly be exciting--and unforgettable.	296	March 7th 1977			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38486.Starring_Sally_J_Freedman_as_Herself
