Ancient Sorceries and Other Weird Stories		Algernon Blackwood, S.T. Joshi	4.13	1806	121	"Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found hereSpine-tingling supernatural tales from ""the one absolute and unquestioned master of weird atmosphere"" (H.P. Lovecraft)By turns bizarre, unsettling, spooky, and sublime, Ancient Sorceries and Other Weird Stories showcases nine incomparable stories from master conjuror Algernon Blackwood. Evoking the uncanny spiritual forces of Nature, Blackwood's writings all tread the nebulous borderland between fantasy, awe, wonder, and horror. Here Blackwood displays his best and most disturbing work-including the title story, the inspiration for Val Lewton's classic film Cat People; ""The Willows,"" which Lovecraft singled out as ""the single finest weird tale in literature""; ""The Wendigo""; ""The Insanity of Jones""; and ""Sand.""""Of the equality of Mr. Blackwood's genius there can be no dispute; for no one has ever approached the skill, seriousness, and minute fidelity with which he records the overtones of strangeness in ordinary things and experiences."" --H.P. Lovecraft"	400	July 30th 2001			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93220.Ancient_Sorceries_and_Other_Weird_Stories
