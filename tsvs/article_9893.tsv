Hitler	Hitler #1-2	Ian Kershaw	4.32	4188	305	"""The Hitler biography of the twenty-first century"" (Richard J. Evans), Ian Kershaw's Hitler is a new, distilled, one-volume masterpiece that will become the standard work. From Hitler's origins as a failed artist in fin-de-siecle Vienna to the terrifying last days in his Berlin bunker, Kershaw's richly illustrated biography is a mesmerizing portrait of how Hitler attained, exercised, and retained power. Drawing on previously untapped sources, such as Goebbels's diaries, Kershaw addresses crucial questions about the unique nature of Nazi radicalism, about the Holocaust, and about the poisoned European world that allowed Hitler to operate so effectively."	1072	1991	Alois Hitler, Klara Hitler, Rudolf Hess, Hermann Göring, Benito Mussolini, Geli Raubal, Ernst Röhm, Dietrich Eckart, Josef Goebbels, Gregor Strasser, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Ernst Hanfstaengl, Erich Ludendorff, Paul von Hindenburg, Heinrich Brüning, Gottfried Feder, Anton Drexler, August Kubizek, Karl Mayr, Franz von Papen, Kurt von Schuschnigg, Walther von Brauchitsch, Adolf Hitler, Albert Speer	Braunau am Inn Leonding Linz Vienna Munich (München) Landsberg am Lech Berlin	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3741342-hitler
