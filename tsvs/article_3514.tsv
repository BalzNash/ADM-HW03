The Yellow Wall-Paper		Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Elaine Hedges	4.10	92489	4941	‘It is stripped off - the paper - in great patches . . . The colour is repellent . . . In the places where it isn’t faded and where the sun is just so - I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to skulk about . . .’Based on the author’s own experiences, 'The Yellow Wallpaper' is the chilling tale of a woman driven to the brink of insanity by the ‘rest cure’ prescribed after the birth of her child. Isolated in a crumbling colonial mansion, in a room with bars on the windows, the tortuous pattern of the yellow wallpaper winds its way into the recesses of her mind.	64	January 10th 1892			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/286957.The_Yellow_Wall_Paper
