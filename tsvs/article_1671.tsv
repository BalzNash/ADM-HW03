Dreamland		Sarah Dessen	3.90	74805	4276	There is an alternate cover edition for this ISBN13 here.Wake up, CaitlinEver since she started going out with Rogerson Biscoe, Caitlin seems to have fallen into a semiconscious dreamland where nothing is quite real. Rogerson is different from anyone Caitlin has ever known. He's magnetic. He's compelling. He's dangerous. Being with him makes Caitlin forget about everything else--her missing sister, her withdrawn mother, her lackluster life. But what happens when being with Rogerson becomes a larger problem than being without him?	250	September 1st 2000	Caitlin O'Koren, Rogerson Biscoe, Boo Connel	Lakeview, North Carolina	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4325.Dreamland
