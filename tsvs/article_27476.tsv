Border Songs		Jim Lynch	3.64	2357	451	Brandon Vanderkool’s severe dyslexia and six-foot-eight height give him an unusual perspective on his new job with the American Border Patrol, along the Washington/BC border â€” just a long, grassy ditch, really, barely dividing neighbours who used to be as congenial as those in any small community. Though his curious mind proves surprisingly adept at intercepting Canadian pot smugglers and potentially dangerous illegals, years of security hysteria and cross-border resentment â€” and a fascinating young Canadian who has turned her green thumb to a more lucrative crop â€” complicate Brandon’ s world in ways even he might not be able to see past.Border Songs is that rare delight: a gently satirical portrait, an extraordinary love story and a celebration of the coincidental and the miraculous.From the Hardcover edition.	304	January 1st 2009		British Columbia Washington (state) Canada United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6098855-border-songs
