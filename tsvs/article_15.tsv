The Da Vinci Code	Robert Langdon #2	Dan Brown	3.86	1944394	47326	ISBN 9780307277671 moved to this edition.While in Paris, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon is awakened by a phone call in the dead of the night. The elderly curator of the Louvre has been murdered inside the museum, his body covered in baffling symbols. As Langdon and gifted French cryptologist Sophie Neveu sort through the bizarre riddles, they are stunned to discover a trail of clues hidden in the works of Leonardo da Vinci—clues visible for all to see and yet ingeniously disguised by the painter.Even more startling, the late curator was involved in the Priory of Sion—a secret society whose members included Sir Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, and Da Vinci—and he guarded a breathtaking historical secret. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the labyrinthine puzzle—while avoiding the faceless adversary who shadows their every move—the explosive, ancient truth will be lost forever.	489	March 18th 2003	Sophie Neveu, Robert Langdon, Sir Leigh Teabing, Silas (The Da Vinci Code), Bezu Fache, Jerome Collet, Manuel Aringarosa, Rémy Legaludec, André Vernet	Paris London, England France England United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/968.The_Da_Vinci_Code
