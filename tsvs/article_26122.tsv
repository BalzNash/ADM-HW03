Up in Honey's Room	Carl Webster #2	Elmore Leonard	3.43	2643	321	"Walter Schoen isn't just a Heinrich Himmler look-alike; this Detroit butcher is a dedicated Nazi spy who, when not busy slicing sausage, is avidly assembling Allied production data for his friends in Berlin. Tired of his covert shenanigans, his wife, Honey, divorces him. Looking for a good time, if not more, she lands in the lap of Carl Webster, the ""Hot Kid"" of the U.S. Marshals Service. At the moment though, the only couplings that interest Webster are the handcuffs that he'd like to snap onto the wrists of Hitler's American helpers. Elmore Leonard's unconventional crime novel has more wrinkles than a bloodhound."	292	May 8th 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/288956.Up_in_Honey_s_Room
