Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry	Logans #4	Mildred D. Taylor	3.84	113094	5156	Why is the land so important to Cassie's family? It takes the events of one turbulent year—the year of the night riders and the burnings, the year a white girl humiliates Cassie in public simply because she's black—to show Cassie that having a place of their own is the Logan family's lifeblood. It is the land that gives the Logans their courage and pride—no matter how others may degrade them, the Logans possess something no one can take away.	288	October 1st 1976	Cassie Logan, Stacey Logan, Christopher John, Papa	Mississippi	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/310459.Roll_of_Thunder_Hear_My_Cry
