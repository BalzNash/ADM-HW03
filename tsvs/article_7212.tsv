A boy looking for a hero, Joey decides to latch on to Charlie Banks, the all-star third basemen for the New York Giants. But Joey's chosen champion doesn't exactly welcome the extreme attention of a persistent young fan with an overactive imagination. Then again, this strange, needy kid might be exactly what Banks needs.	368	June 1st 1998		Brooklyn, New York City, New York New York State	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/113773.Last_Days_of_Summer
