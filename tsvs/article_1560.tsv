After just one day together, that spark bursts into a flame, or so it seems to Allyson, until the following morning, when she wakes up after a whirlwind day in Paris to discover that Willem has left. Over the next year, Allyson embarks on a journey to come to terms with the narrow confines of her life, and through Shakespeare, travel, and a quest for her almost-true-love, to break free of those confines."	369	January 8th 2013	Allyson Healey, Willem De Ruiter	Paris Amsterdam Utrecht United States of America London, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623975-just-one-day
