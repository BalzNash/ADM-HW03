The Story of Ferdinand		Munro Leaf, Robert Lawson	4.35	86300	1813	A true classic with a timeless message, The Story of Ferdinand has enchanted readers since it was first published in 1936. All the other bulls would run and jump and butt their heads together. But Ferdinand would rather sit and smell the flowers. And he does just that, until the day a bumblebee and some men from the Madrid bullfights give gentle Ferdinand a chance to be the most ferocious star of the corrida—and the most unexpected comic hero. This cherished hardcover is perfect for those who love Ferdinand, and those who have yet to meet him.	72	January 1st 1936		Spain Madrid	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/773951.The_Story_of_Ferdinand
