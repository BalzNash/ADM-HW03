The Young Lions		Irwin Shaw	4.20	3300	192	The Young Lions is a vivid and classic novel that portrays the experiences of ordinary soldiers fighting World War II. Told from the points of view of a perceptive young Nazi, a jaded American film producer, and a shy Jewish boy just married to the love of his life, Shaw conveys, as no other novelist has since, the scope, confusion, and complexity of war.	662	1948	Michael Whiteacre, Hope Plowman, Christian Diestl, Noah Ackerman, Gretchen Hardenburg, Mincey, Wallace Arney, Leroy Keane, Papuga, Ottilie Munsell Kearney, Pfeiffer, W.
