Midnight's Children		Salman Rushdie	3.98	104943	6441	"Saleem Sinai was born at midnight, the midnight of India's independence, and found himself mysteriously ""handcuffed to history"" by the coincidence. He is one of 1,001 children born at the midnight hour, each of them endowed with an extraordinary talent—and whose privilege and curse it is to be both master and victims of their times. Through Saleem's gifts—inner ear and wildly sensitive sense of smell—we are drawn into a fascinating family saga set against the vast, colourful background of the India of the 20th century."	647	April 1981	Saleem Sinai	India Pakistan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14836.Midnight_s_Children
