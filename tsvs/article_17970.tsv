Staff Sergeant Darrell “Skip” Griffin, Jr. was killed in action onMarch 21, 2007, during his second tour of duty in Iraq. He was awardedthe Purple Heart and the Bronze Star with Valor for dragging a comradeto safety through enemy gunfire. He was also in the middle of writing abook. Tentatively titled The Great Conversation,it was an attempt to describe and make sense of the destruction he hadseen in Iraq. His father, Darrell Griffin, Sr., was going to help himfinish writing it when he returned home in July. In the face of Skip’s death, Darrell, Sr. vowed to finish the bookhimself. He traveled to Iraq, witnessing the war close up and meetinghis son’s comrades. Driven by a conviction that Americans do not knowenough about the war they have been fighting for the past six years, Last Journey isa first-hand account of everyday life for soldiers in Iraq; it’s alsoan intimate portrait of a lost son, a meditation on faith, and finallya tribute to the lively philosophical debates the Griffins used toshare. Included is email correspondence with Skip during the weeksbefore he died as well as original photographs from the frontlines.Passionate and inspiring, Last Journey serves as a tragic reminder of the human cost of war.	304	June 1st 2009			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6261155-last-journey
