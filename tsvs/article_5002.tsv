A Single Man		Christopher Isherwood	4.10	23964	1903	"""When A Single Man was originally published, it shocked many by its frank, sympathetic, and moving portrayal of a gay man in midlife. George, the protagonist, is adjusting to life on his own after the sudden death of his partner, determined to persist in the routines of his daily life. An Englishman and a professor living in suburban Southern California, he is an outsider in every way, and his internal reflections and interactions with others reveal a man who loves being alive despite everyday injustices and loneliness. Wry, suddenly manic, constantly funny, surprisingly sad, this novel catches the true textures of life itself.""--BOOK JACKET."	192	1964	George Falconer, Kenny Potter, Charley, Jim	Los Angeles, California	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16842.A_Single_Man
