The Midwife's Apprentice		Karen Cushman	3.72	39870	1850	"From the author of Catherine, Called Birdy comes another spellbinding novel set in medieval England. The girl known only as Brat has no family, no home, and no future until she meets Jane the Midwife and becomes her apprentice. As she helps the sharp-tempered Jane deliver babies, Brat--who renames herself Alyce--gains knowledge, confidence, and the courage to want something from life: ""A full belly, a contented heart, and a place in this world."" Medieval village life makes a lively backdrop for the funny, poignant story of how Alyce gets what she wants. A concluding note discusses midwifery past and present. A Newbery Medal book."	128	January 1st 1995	Alyce, Jane the Midwife, Will Russet, Magister Richard Reese	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15595.The_Midwife_s_Apprentice
