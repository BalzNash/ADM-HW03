Seriously... I'm Kidding		Ellen DeGeneres	3.70	103555	7575	"""Sometimes the greatest things are the most embarrassing."" Ellen Degeneres' winning, upbeat candor has made her show one of the most popular, resilient and honored daytime shows on the air. (To date, it has won no fewer than 31 Emmys.) Seriously... I'm Kidding, Degeneres' first book in eight years, brings us up to date about the life of a kindhearted woman who bowed out of American Idol because she didn't want to be mean. Lively; hilarious; often sweetly poignant."	241	October 4th 2011			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11230081-seriously-i-m-kidding
