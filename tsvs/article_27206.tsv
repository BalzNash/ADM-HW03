Bodies and Souls: A Novel		John Rechy	3.71	77	10	"In Bodies and Souls, Rechy paints a portrait of modern Los Angeles, ""the most spiritual and physical of cities,"" where we meet characters like Amber, a porn superstar; Manny Gomez, a Chicano caught up in the punk-rock scene; and Dave Clinton, an aging male stripper. Epic in scope and vision, Bodies and Souls is classic Rechy."	432	June 1st 1983			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/109714.Bodies_and_Souls
