Believing Christ: The Parable of the Bicycle and Other Good News		Stephen E. Robinson	4.50	14747	889	Author Stephen Robinson illustrates the power of the Savior as he uses analogies and parables, such as his own bicycle story, and scriptures and personal experiences in this moving, best-selling book. “Mortals have finite liabilities,” he explains, “and Jesus has unlimited assets.” By merging the two, exaltation can come. As long as we progress in some degree, the Lord will be pleased and will bless us. We must not only believe in Christ but also believe him — believe that he has the power to exalt us, that he can do what he claims. People will better understand the doctrines of mercy, justification, and salvation by grace after reading this book.	125	January 1st 1992		United States of America Salt Lake City, Utah	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/434764.Believing_Christ
