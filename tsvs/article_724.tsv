Angle of Repose		Wallace Stegner	4.23	54696	4471	Wallace Stegner's Pultizer Prize-winning novel is a story of discovery—personal, historical, and geographical. Confined to a wheelchair, retired historian Lyman Ward sets out to write his grandparents' remarkable story, chronicling their days spent carving civilization into the surface of America's western frontier. But his research reveals even more about his own life than he's willing to admit. What emerges is an enthralling portrait of four generations in the life of an American family.	569	March 1st 1971	Lyman Ward, Susan Burling Ward, Oliver Ward, Rodman Ward, Frank Sargent, Ada Topham, Shelly Rasmussen, Ellen Ward	American West California Idaho	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/292408.Angle_of_Repose
