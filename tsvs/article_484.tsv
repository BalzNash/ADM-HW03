Snow Falling on Cedars		David Guterson	3.84	166638	4808	Gripping, tragic, and densely atmosphericâ€”a masterpiece of suspense San Piedro Island, north of Puget Sound, is a place so isolated that no one who lives there can afford to make enemies. But in 1954 a local fisherman is found suspiciously drowned, and a Japanese American named Kabuo Miyamoto is charged with his murder. In the course of the ensuing trial, it becomes clear that what is at stake is more than a man's guilt. For on San Pedro, memories of a charmed love affair between a white boy and the Japanese girl who grew up to become Kabuo's wife; memories of land desired, paid for, and lost. Above all, San Piedro is haunted by the memory of what happened to its Japanese residents during World War II, when an entire community was sent into exile while its neighbors watched.	460	September 12th 1994	Kabuo Miyamoto, Ishmael Chambers, Hatsue Miyamoto, Carl Heine	San Piedro Island, Washington	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77142.Snow_Falling_on_Cedars
