The Riddle of the Sands		Erskine Childers, Milton Bearden	3.63	5527	559	While on a sailing trip in the Baltic Sea, two young adventurers-turned-spies uncover a secret German plot to invade England. Written by Childers—who served in the Royal Navy during World War I—as a wake-up call to the British government to attend to its North Sea defenses, The Riddle of the Sands accomplished that task and has been considered a classic of espionage literature ever since, praised as much for its nautical action as for its suspenseful spycraft.	336	1903	Carruthers, Arthur Davies, Bartels, Dollmann, Clara Dollmann, von Brüning, Böhme	Germany Kiel (Hauptstadt)	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/406575.The_Riddle_of_the_Sands
