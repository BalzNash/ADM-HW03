The Years of Rice and Salt		Kim Stanley Robinson	3.74	11320	1260	It is the fourteenth century and one of the most apocalyptic events in human history is set to occur - the coming of the Black Death. History teaches us that a third of Europe's population was destroyed. But what if? What if the plague killed 99 percent of the population instead? How would the world have changed? This is a look at the history that could have been: a history that stretches across centuries, a history that sees dynasties and nations rise and crumble, a history that spans horrible famine and magnificent innovation. These are the years of rice and salt.	763	June 3rd 2002		France	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2723.The_Years_of_Rice_and_Salt
