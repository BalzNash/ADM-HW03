Black-Eyed Suzie		Susan Shaw	4.16	537	67	"Suzie is a dark-eyed twelve-year-old who desperately needs to feel safe and worthy of love. Seeking only to be ""good enough,"" she remains motionless and silent for hours on end, feeling the walls of her psychological prison pressing against her. Ultimately, Suzie finds herself in a mental hospital where she begins a long and fear-filled journey. To make sense of her world, Suzie must piece together a puzzle that involves seemingly unrelated clues--a broken bicycle, a torn picture, peacock feathers, and more--which together reveal a secret that is likely to change Suzie's life forever, and give her an opportunity to regain her voice and reclaim her spirit."	176	March 2002 by			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1611127.Black_Eyed_Suzie
