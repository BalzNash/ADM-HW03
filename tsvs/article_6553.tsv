No One Here Gets Out Alive		Danny Sugerman, Jerry Hopkins	3.92	38795	794	"Here is Jim Morrison in all his complexity-singer, philosopher, poet, delinquent-the brilliant, charismatic, and obsessed seeker who rejected authority in any form, the explorer who probed ""the bounds of reality to see what would happen..."" Seven years in the writing, this definitive biography is the work of two men whose empathy and experience with Jim Morrison uniquely prepared them to recount this modern tragedy: Jerry Hopkins, whose famous Presley biography, Elvis, was inspired by Morrison's suggestion, and Danny Sugerman, confidant of and aide to the Doors. With an afterword by Michael McClure."	384	1980	Jim Morrison, Bill Siddons, Danny Fields, Patricia Kennely	Los Angeles, California New York City, New York San Francisco, California Paris Sunset Strip, Hollywood, California Albuquerque, New Mexico	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/691520.No_One_Here_Gets_Out_Alive
