The Lab	Agent Six of Hearts #1	Jack Heath	3.88	1861	131	The start of a fantastic new action/adventure series from a 20-yr-old author who knows how to thrillIn a near-future world run by an evil corporation, the only justice comes from an organization called the Deck. Each agent in the deck belongs to a suit -- the Hearts and Diamonds are the operatives, the Clubs do the training, and the Spades monitor internal affairs. The hero is a 16-yr-old, Six of Hearts. (The highest ranking in each group is the King, and so forth, with the whole shebang led by the two Jokers). Six of Hearts is the best operative they have -- all the more impressive (and convenient for us) because he never kills anyone.	320	2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5332742-the-lab
