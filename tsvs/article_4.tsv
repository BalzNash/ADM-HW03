Pride and Prejudice		Jane Austen, Anna Quindlen	4.26	3019988	67860	"Alternate cover edition of ISBN 9780679783268Since its immediate success in 1813, Pride and Prejudice has remained one of the most popular novels in the English language. Jane Austen called this brilliant work ""her own darling child"" and its vivacious heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print."" The romantic clash between the opinionated Elizabeth and her proud beau, Mr. Darcy, is a splendid performance of civilized sparring. And Jane Austen's radiant wit sparkles as her characters dance a delicate quadrille of flirtation and intrigue, making this book the most superb comedy of manners of Regency England."	279	January 28th 1813	Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet, Jane Bennet, Elizabeth Bennet, Mary Bennet, Kitty Bennet, Lydia Bennet, Louisa Hurst, Caroline Bingley, Fitzwilliam Darcy, Georgiana Darcy, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Anne de Bourgh, Colonel Fitzwilliam, Mr. Gardiner, Mrs. Gardiner, Sir William Lucas, Lady Lucas, Charlotte Lucas, Maria Lucas, Mr. Darcy, Charles Bingley, George Wickham, Mr. William Collins	United Kingdom Derbyshire, England England Hertfordshire, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1885.Pride_and_Prejudice
