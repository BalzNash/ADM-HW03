These Is My Words: The Diary of Sarah Agnes Prine, 1881-1901, Arizona Territories	Sarah Agnes Prine #1	Nancy E. Turner	4.34	66584	10484	A moving, exciting, and heartfelt American saga inspired by the author's own family memoirs, these words belong to Sarah Prine, a woman of spirit and fire who forges a full and remarkable existence in a harsh, unfamiliar frontier. Scrupulously recording her steps down the path Providence has set her upon--from child to determined young adult to loving mother--she shares the turbulent events, both joyous and tragic, that molded her and recalls the enduring love with cavalry officer Captain Jack Elliot that gave her strength and purpose.Rich in authentic everyday details and alive with truly unforgettable characters, These Is My Words brilliantly brings a vanished world to breathtaking life again.	384	February 3rd 1998		Arizona Territory	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2641307-these-is-my-words
