Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience		Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi	4.11	55744	2876	"Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's investigations of ""optimal experience"" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called flow. During flow, people typically experience deep enjoyment, creativity, and a total involvement with life. Csikszentmihalyi demonstrates the ways this positive state can be controlled, not just left to chance. Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience teaches how, by ordering the information that enters our consciousness, we can discover true happiness, unlock our potential, and greatly improve the quality of our lives."	303	January 1st 1990			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow
