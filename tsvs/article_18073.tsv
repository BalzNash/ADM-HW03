A Language Older Than Words		Derrick Jensen	4.29	2475	214	At once a beautifully poetic memoir and an exploration of the various ways we live in the world, A Language Older Than Words explains violence as a pathology that touches every aspect of our lives and indeed affects all aspects of life on Earth. This chronicle of a young man's drive to transcend domestic abuse offers a challenging look at our worldwide sense of community and how we can make things better.	418	2000			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60970.A_Language_Older_Than_Words
