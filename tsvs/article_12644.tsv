Breath of Scandal		Sandra Brown	4.04	12607	720	"On a rainy Southern night, Jade Sperry endured a young woman's worst nightmare at the hands of three local hell-raisers. Robbed of her youthful ideals and at the center of scandal and tragedy, Jade ran as far and as fast as she could. But she never forgot the sleepy ""company town"" where every man, woman, and child was dependent on one wealthy family. And she never forgot their spoiled son, who, with his two friends, changed her life forever. Someday, somehow, she'd return, exact a just revenge -- and free herself from fear, and the powerful family that could destroy her."	464	1991	Jade Sperry, Dillon Burke, Neal Patchett, Hutch Jolly, Lamar Griffith	Palmetto, South Carolina New York City, New York Palmetto, South Carolina Atlanta, Georgia Morgantown, West Virginia Columbia, South Carolina Tallahassee, Florida	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/760924.Breath_of_Scandal
