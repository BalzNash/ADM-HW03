Tricks	Tricks #1	Ellen Hopkins	4.29	34122	1799	"Five teenagers from different parts of the country. Three girls. Two guys. Four straight. One gay. Some rich. Some poor. Some from great families. Some with no one at all. All living their lives as best they can, but all searching ... for freedom, safety, community, family, love. What they don't expect, though, is all that can happen when those powerful little words ""I love you"" are said for all the wrong reasons.Five moving stories remain separate at first, then interweave to tell a larger, powerful storyâ€”a story about making choices, taking leaps of faith, falling down, and growing up. A story about kids figuring out what sex and love are all about, at all costs, while asking themselves, ""Can I ever feel okay about myself?"""	627	August 20th 2009	Eden Streit, Seth Parnell, Whitney Lang, Ginger Cordell, Cody Bennett	Las Vegas, Nevada Boise, Idaho Louisville, Kentucky Perry County, Indiana Santa Cruz, California Barstow, California	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5510384-tricks
