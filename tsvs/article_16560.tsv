The Transit of Venus		Shirley Hazzard	3.91	2225	405	Caro, gallant and adventurous, is one of two Australian sisters who have come to post-war England to seek their fortunes. Courted long and hopelessly by young scientist, Ted Tice, she is to find that love brings passion, sorrow, betrayal and finally hope. The milder Grace seeks fulfilment in an apparently happy marriage. But as the decades pass and the characters weave in and out of each other's lives, love, death and two slow-burning secrets wait in ambush for them.	352	1980	Caroline Bell, Grace Bell, Ted Tice, Paul Ivory, Adam Vail, Christian Thrale, Dora Bell, Tertia Drage, Sefton Thrale, Charmian Thrale, Major Bruce Ingot, Cordelia Ware, Josie Vail, Margaret Tice, Angus Dance, Nicholas Cartledge, Clive Leadbetter, Armand Elphinstone, Glad Pomfret, Victor Locker, Ernesto Prata, Gwen Morphew	London, England Sydney, New South Wales New York City, New York England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12738.The_Transit_of_Venus
