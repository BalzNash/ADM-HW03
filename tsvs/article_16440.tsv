Appleseed, Vol. 1: The Promethean Challenge	Appleseed #1	Masamune Shirow	3.95	1460	44	Functional simplicity, structural complexity: the best life for all. That's the maxim of Olympus, the utopian city that sprung from the ashes of World War III. But Deunan and Bri, a young woman and her cyborg companion just entering the rose-tinted society, find that so long as there are different kinds of people there will be differences among them. Such is the story of Appleseed, the masterwork of manga storyteller Masamune Shirow. Beautiful art and a complex and fully realized future world rank this title among the best comics available.	132	February 15th 1985			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/918866.Appleseed_Vol_1
