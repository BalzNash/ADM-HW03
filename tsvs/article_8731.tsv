Shift	Shifters #5	Rachel Vincent	4.22	16084	588	Being the first female werecat enforcer isn't easy. Scars accumulate, but I'm stronger in so many ways.As for my personal life? It's complicated. Choices worth making always are. Ever since my brother's death and my father's impeachment, it's all I can do to prevent more blood from spilling. Now our Pride is under attack by a flight of vicious thunderbirds. And making peace with our new enemies may be the only way to get the best of our old foe.With the body count rising and treachery everywhere, my instincts tell me to look before I leap. But sometimes a leap of faith is the only real option...	441	February 17th 2010	Marc Ramos, Faythe Sanders, Jace Hammond	Texas New Mexico Kentucky	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6938348-shift
