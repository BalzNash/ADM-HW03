What I Loved		Siri Hustvedt	4.06	15669	1328	This is the story of two men who first become friends in 1970s New York, of the women in their lives, of their sons, born the same year, and of how relations between the two families become strained, first by tragedy, then by a monstrous duplicity which comes slowly and corrosively to the surface.	370	2002		New York State New York State New York City, New York	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/125502.What_I_Loved
