A Season in Purgatory		Dominick Dunne	4.10	2773	205	They were the family with everything. Money. Influence. Glamour. Power. The power to halt a police investigation in its tracks. The power to spin a story, concoct a lie, and believe it was the truth. The power to murder without guilt, without shame, and without ever paying the price. America's royalty, they called the Bradleys. But an outsider refuses to play his part. And now, the day of reckoning has arrived. . . .	464	1993		Connecticut	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18238.A_Season_in_Purgatory
