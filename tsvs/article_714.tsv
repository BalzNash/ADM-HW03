Club Dead	Sookie Stackhouse #3	Charlaine Harris	4.01	222258	5494	Things between cocktail waitress Sookie and her vampire boyfriend Bill seem to be going excellently (apart from the small matter of him being undead) until he leaves town for a while. A long while. Bill's sinister boss Eric has an idea of where to find him, whisking her off to Jackson, Mississippi to mingle with the under-underworld at Club Dead. When she finally catches up with the errant vampire, he is in big trouble and caught in an act of serious betrayal. This raises serious doubts as to whether she should save him or start sharpening a few stakes of her own ..	274	May 2003	Sookie Stackhouse, Bill Compton, Sam Merlotte, Jason Stackhouse, Eric Northman, Tara Thornton, Pam Ravenscroft, Russell Edgington, Alcide Herveaux	Jackson, Mississippi Bon Temps, Louisiana	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/140082.Club_Dead
