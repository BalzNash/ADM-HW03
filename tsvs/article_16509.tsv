View with a Grain of Sand: Selected Poems		Wisława Szymborska, Stanisław Barańczak, Clare Cavanagh	4.34	4054	269	In these one-hundred poems Wisława Szymborska portrays a world of astonishing diversity and richness, in which nature is wise and prodigal and fate unpredictable, if not mischevious. With acute irony tempered by a generous curiousity, she documents life's improbability as well as its transient beauty.	214	1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10203.View_with_a_Grain_of_Sand
