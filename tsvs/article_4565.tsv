He is not sure where he's going or why, but it means that he gets to sit in the front seat of a silver van with his beloved owner, Satoru.

Nana does not know and Satoru won't say. But when Nana finally works it out, his small heart will break...	288	November 2012			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40961230-the-travelling-cat-chronicles
