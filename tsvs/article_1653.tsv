Twilight	The Mediator #6	Meg Cabot	4.24	39131	1147	This time it's life or death.Suze has gotten used to ghosts. She's a mediator, after all, and communicating with the dead is all in a day's work. So she certainly never expected to fall in love with one: Jesse, a nineteenth-century hottie. But when she discovers that she has the power to determine who becomes a ghost in the first place, Suze begins to freak. It means she can alter the course of history... and prevent Jesse's murder, keeping him from ever becoming a ghost - and from ever meeting Suze.Will Jesse choose to live without her, or die to love her?	312	February 1st 2005	"Hector de Silva (Jesse), Susannah ""Suze"" Simon, Paul Slater, Kelly Prescott, Father Dominic, Jake Ackerman (Sleepy), Brad Ackerman (Dopey), David Ackerman (Doc), Sister Ernestine"	Carmel-by-the-Sea, California	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/93724.Twilight
