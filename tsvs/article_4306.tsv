The Seven Storey Mountain		Thomas Merton, Robert Giroux, William H. Shannon	4.07	15563	1076	"One of the most famous books ever written about a man’s search for faith and peace. The Seven Storey Mountain tells of the growing restlessness of a brilliant and passionate young man, who at the age of twenty-six, takes vows in one of the most demanding Catholic orders—the Trappist monks. At the Abbey of Gethsemani, ""the four walls of my new freedom,"" Thomas Merton struggles to withdraw from the world, but only after he has fully immersed himself in it. At the abbey, he wrote this extraordinary testament, a unique spiritual autobiography that has been recognized as one of the most influential religious works of our time. Translated into more than twenty languages, it has touched millions of lives."	467	1948		Bardstown, Kentucky	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/175078.The_Seven_Storey_Mountain
