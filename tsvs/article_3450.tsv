Stolen	Otherworld #2	Kelley Armstrong	4.14	43735	1558	"It was in Bitten, Kelley Armstrong's debut novel, that thirty-year-old Elena Michaels came to terms with her feral appetites and claimed the proud identity of a beautiful, successful woman and the only living female werewolf.  In Stolen, on a mission for her own elite pack, she is lured into the net of ruthless Internet billionaire Tyrone Winsloe, who has funded a bogus scientific investigation of the ""other races"" and their supernatural powers. Kidnapped and studied in his underground lab deep in the Maine woods, these paranormals - witches, vampires, shamans, werewolves - are then released and hunted to the death in a real-world video game. But when Winsloe captures Elena, he finally meets his match."	468	December 24th 2002	Elena Michaels, Jeremy Danvers, Clayton Danvers, Savannah Levine, Paige Winterbourne, Adam Vasic, Cassandra DuCharme, Aaron Darnell, Xavier Reese, Leah O'Donnell	Maine	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11922.Stolen
