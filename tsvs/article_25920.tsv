ژان کریستف | جلدِ یکُم از دورۀ چهارجلدی: سپیده‌دَم؛ بامداد؛ نوجوان	Jean-Christophe #1	Romain Rolland, م. ا. به آذین	4.19	715	44	"""One word only! No more talk of money. I hate money--the word and the thing itself. If I am not rich, I am yet rich enough to give to my friend, and it is my joy to give all I can for him. Would not you do the same? And if I needed it, would you not be the first to give me all your fortune? But that shall never be! I have sound fists and a sound head, and I shall always be able to earn the bread that I eat. Till Sunday!"	509	1905			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/73322.Jean_Christophe_I
