My Family and Other Animals	Corfu Trilogy #1	Gerald Durrell	4.21	40016	3350	When the unconventional Durrell family can no longer endure the damp, gray English climate, they do what any sensible family would do: sell their house and relocate to the sunny Greek isle of Corfu. My Family and Other Animals was intended to embrace the natural history of the island but ended up as a delightful account of Durrell’s family’s experiences, from the many eccentric hangers-on to the ceaseless procession of puppies, toads, scorpions, geckoes, ladybugs, glowworms, octopuses, bats, and butterflies into their home.	273	1956	Gerald Durrell, Lawrence Durrell, Margo Durrell, Leslie Durrell	Corfu	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48132.My_Family_and_Other_Animals
