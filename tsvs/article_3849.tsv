Nothing		Janne Teller, Martin Aitken	3.75	22000	3150	When Pierre-Anthon realizes there is no meaning to life, the seventh-grader leaves his classroom, climbs a tree, and stays there. His classmates cannot make him come down, not even by pelting him with rocks. So to prove to Pierre-Anthon that life has meaning, the children decide to give up things of importance. The pile starts with the superficial—a fishing rod, a new pair of shoes. But as the sacrifices become more extreme, the students grow increasingly desperate to get Pierre-Anthon down, to justify their belief in meaning. Sure to prompt intense thought and discussion, Nothing—already a treasured work overseas—is not to be missed.	227	December 2000	Agnes, Pierre-Anthon, Sofie, Ole, Elise	Tæring	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6647312-nothing
