How do you discover your purpose? What does it mean not just to survive, but to truly live?Dear Edward is at once a transcendent coming-of-age story, a multidimensional portrait of an unforgettable cast of characters, and a breathtaking illustration of all the ways a broken heart learns to love again.	352	January 6th 2020		New Jersey	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45294613-dear-edward
