The Talented Mr. Ripley	Ripley #1	Patricia Highsmith	3.93	62682	3382	"Since his debut in 1955, Tom Ripley has evolved into the ultimate bad boy sociopath, influencing countless novelists and filmmakers. In this first novel, we are introduced to suave, handsome Tom Ripley: a young striver, newly arrived in the heady world of Manhattan in the 1950s. A product of a broken home, branded a ""sissy"" by his dismissive Aunt Dottie, Ripley becomes enamored of the moneyed world of his new friend, Dickie Greenleaf. This fondness turns obsessive when Ripley is sent to Italy to bring back his libertine pal but grows enraged by Dickie's ambivalent feelings for Marge, a charming American dilettante. A dark reworking of Henry James's The Ambassadors, The Talented Mr. Ripleyâ€”is up to his tricks in a 90s film and also Rene Clement's 60s film, ""Purple Noon."""	320	1955	Tom Ripley, Dickie Greenleaf, Marge Sherwood, Freddie Miles	Italy New York City, New York Italian Riviera	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2247142.The_Talented_Mr_Ripley
