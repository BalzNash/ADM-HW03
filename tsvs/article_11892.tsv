The Geography of You and Me		Jennifer E. Smith	3.66	32106	3539	Lucy and Owen meet somewhere between the tenth and eleventh floors of a New York City apartment building, on an elevator rendered useless by a citywide blackout. After they’re rescued, they spend a single night together, wandering the darkened streets and marveling at the rare appearance of stars above Manhattan. But once the power is restored, so is reality. Lucy soon moves to Edinburgh with her parents, while Owen heads out west with his father.Lucy and Owen’s relationship plays out across the globe as they stay in touch through postcards, occasional e-mails, and—finally—a reunion in the city where they first met.A carefully charted map of a long-distance relationship, Jennifer E. Smith’s new novel shows that the center of the world isn't necessarily a place. It can be a person, too.	337	April 15th 2014	Lucy Patterson, Owen Buckley	New York State London, England Edinburgh, Scotland Portland, Oregon New York City, New York Chicago, Illinois San Francisco, California Lake Tahoe California	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18295852-the-geography-of-you-and-me
