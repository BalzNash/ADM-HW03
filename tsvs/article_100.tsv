A Prayer for Owen Meany		John Irving	4.23	286711	13851	Eleven-year-old Owen Meany, playing in a Little League baseball game in Gravesend, New Hampshire, hits a foul ball and kills his best friend's mother. Owen doesn't believe in accidents; he believes he is God's instrument. What happens to Owen after that 1953 foul is both extraordinary and terrifying. At moments a comic, self-deluded victim, but in the end the principal, tragic actor in a divine plan, Owen Meany is the most heartbreaking hero John Irving has yet created.	637	March 28th 1989	Owen Meany, John Wheelwright	Gravesend, New Hampshire Toronto, Ontario	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4473.A_Prayer_for_Owen_Meany
