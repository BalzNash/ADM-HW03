Pick Me Up		Zoe Rice	3.56	461	44	Introducing this season's most delightful new heroine.  Yesterday Izzy was a happily single, full-fledged New York gallerista, selling hundred-thousand dollar paintings, and in line for a whopping promotion. Today? The ancient owner of the gallery dropped dead, leaving Izzy's entire professional future in the hands of the new owner, Avery Devon. And if all goes right, her personal future as well. Because if there's one thing Izzy is well-acquainted with, it's the fine art of love.	320	June 6th 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/380792.Pick_Me_Up
