The World According to Garp		John Irving	4.09	205253	5509	"This is the life and times of T. S. Garp, the bastard son of Jenny Fields—a feminist leader ahead of her times. This is the life and death of a famous mother and her almost-famous son; theirs is a world of sexual extremes—even of sexual assassinations. It is a novel rich with ""lunacy and sorrow""; yet the dark, violent events of the story do not undermine a comedy both ribald and robust. In more than thirty languages, in more than forty countries—with more than ten million copies in print—this novel provides almost cheerful, even hilarious evidence of its famous last line: ""In the world according to Garp, we are all terminal cases."""	610	April 24th 1978	T.S. Garp, Jenny Fields, Helen Garp, Roberta Muldoon	Vienna	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7069.The_World_According_to_Garp
