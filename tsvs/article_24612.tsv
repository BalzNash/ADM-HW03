Now her hometown community center is in danger of being sold. The only hope for its salvation is if Jenny can film and sell the Christmas Revels production she's directing. A really good cameraman is needed-and she knows just the one.... Greg Marino is a top Hollywood cinematographer with an Oscar in his kitchen to prove it. He also has fond memories of the fling he once had with Jenny Lyme when they worked together on a disastrous movie. So when Jenny calls and asks Greg to film her Christmas show, he decides it'd be a fun break... and really, really nice to see Jenny again. But how can they build a life together when both have demanding careers thousands of miles apart?
