Tortured for Christ		Richard Wurmbrand	4.37	13712	573	One Man Who Dared to Stand UpMonths of solitary confinement, years of periodic physical torture, constant suffering from hunger and cold, the anguish of brainwashing and mental cruelty—these are the experiences of a Romanian pastor during his 14 years in Communist prisons.His crime, like that of thousands of others, was his fervant belief in Jesus Christ and his public witness concerning that faith.Meeting in homes, in basements, and in woods—sometimes daring to preach in public on street corners—these faithful souls persisted in their Christian witness knowing full well the ultimate cost of their actions.This is their story—a classic account of courage, tenacious faith, and unbelievable endurance. This history of the Underground Church reflects the continuing struggle in many parts of the world today.	155	June 1st 1967		Romania	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/78629.Tortured_for_Christ
