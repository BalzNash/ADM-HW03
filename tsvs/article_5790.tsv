Dark Tower Boxed Set	The Dark Tower #1-4	Stephen King	4.50	4997	97	Set in a world of ominous landscape and macabre menace, The Dark Tower features one of Stephen King’s most powerful creations—The Gunslinger, a haunting figure who embodies the qualities of the lone hero through the ages, from ancient myth to frontier Western legend. As Roland crosses a desert of damnation in a macabre world that is a twisted image of our own, he moves ever closer to the Dark Tower of his dreams—and nightmares.		2002	John Coffey	United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5092.Dark_Tower_Boxed_Set
