The Gun Seller		Hugh Laurie	3.68	19471	1940	When Thomas Lang, a hired gunman with a soft heart, is contracted to assassinate an American industrialist, he opts instead to warn the intended victim - a good deed that doesn't go unpunished. Within hours Lang is butting heads with a Buddha statue, matching wits with evil billionaires, and putting his life (among other things) in the hands of a bevy of femmes fatales, whilst trying to save a beautiful lady ...and prevent an international bloodbath to boot.	340	May 1st 1996	Thomas Lang	London, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45234.The_Gun_Seller
