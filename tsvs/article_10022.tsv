The Talismans of Shannara	Heritage of Shannara #4	Terry Brooks	4.03	37720	230	Although some of the goals to keep Shannara safe had been met, the work of Walker Boh, Wren, and Par was not yet done. For The Shadowen still swarmed over the Four Lands, poisoning all with their dark magic. Each Shannaran had a special death waiting for him- at the hands of The Shadowen-unless Par could find a way to free them all with the Sword of Shannara.	440	March 1993			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34919.The_Talismans_of_Shannara
