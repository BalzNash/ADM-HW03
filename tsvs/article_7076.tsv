Ghostgirl	Ghostgirl #1	Tonya Hurley	3.29	17578	1363	Now I lay me down to sleep,I pray the Lord my soul to keep.And if I should die before I awake,I pray the popular attend my wake.Charlotte Usher feels practically invisible at school, and then one day she really is invisible. Even worse: she's dead. And all because she choked on a gummy bear. But being dead doesn't stop Charlotte from wanting to be popular; it just makes her more creative about achieving her goal. If you thought high school was a matter of life or death, wait till you see just how true that is. In this satirical, yet heartfelt novel, Hurley explores the invisibility we all feel at some times and the lengths we'll go to be seen.	328	January 1st 2008	Charlotte Usher, Scarlet Kensington, Damon Dylan		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2508164.Ghostgirl
