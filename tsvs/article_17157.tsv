Dance of the Happy Shades		Alice Munro	4.11	3163	284	Alice Munro's territory is the farms and semi-rural towns of south-western Ontario. In these dazzling stories she deals with the self-discovery of adolescence, the joys and pains of love and the despair and guilt of those caught in a narrow existence. And in sensitively exploring the lives of ordinary men and women, she makes us aware of the universal nature of their fears, sorrows and aspirations.	240	1968		Canada	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/322662.Dance_of_the_Happy_Shades
