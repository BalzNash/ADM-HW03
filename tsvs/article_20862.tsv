Adios, Nirvana		Conrad  Wesselhoeft	3.97	479	108	Since the death of his brother, Jonathan’s been losing his grip on reality. Last year’s Best Young Poet and gifted guitarist is now Taft High School’s resident tortured artist, when he bothers to show up. He's on track to repeat eleventh grade, but his English teacher, his principal, and his crew of Thicks (who refuse to be seniors without him) won’t sit back and let him fail.	240	January 1st 2010		West Seattle	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7891973-adios-nirvana
