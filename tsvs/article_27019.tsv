Дъблинчани/ Портрет на художника като млад		James Joyce, Джеймс Джойс, Асен Георгиев Христофоров, Николай Попов	3.94	6462	134	Widely regarded as a great stylist of 20th-century English literature, Joyce deserves the term 'revolutionary'. His literary experiments in form &amp; structure, language &amp; content, signaled the modernist movement &amp; continue to influence writers today. His two earliest, most accessible, successes--A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man &amp; Dubliners--are here brought together in one volume. Both reflect his lifelong love-hate relationship with Dublin &amp; the Irish culture that formed him.  In the semi-autobiographical Portrait, young Stephen Dedalus yearns to be an artist, but 1st must struggle against the forces of church, school &amp; society, which fetter his imagination &amp; stifle his soul. The book's inventive style is apparent from its opening pages, a record of an infant's impressions of the world around him--one of the 1st examples of the stream of consciousness technique. Comprising 15 stories, Dubliners presents a community of mesmerizing, humorous &amp; haunting characters--a group portrait. The interactions among them form one long meditation on the human condition, culminating with 'The Dead', one of Joyce's most graceful compositions centering around a character's epiphany. A carefully woven tapestry of Dublin life at the turn of the last century, Dubliners realizes Joyce's ambition to give his countrymen 'one good look at themselves.'	672	1914			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23296.A_Portrait_of_the_Artist_as_a_Young_Man_Dubliners
