Speak: The Graphic Novel		Laurie Halse Anderson, Emily Carroll	4.39	11258	1902	"The modern classic Speak is now a graphic novel.""Speak up for yourself-we want to know what you have to say."" From the first moment of her freshman year at Merryweather High, Melinda knows this is a big fat lie, part of the nonsense of high school. She is friendless--an outcast--because she busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so now nobody will talk to her, let alone listen to her. Through her work on an art project, she is finally able to face what really happened that night: She was raped by an upperclassman, a guy who still attends Merryweather and is still a threat to her."	376	February 6th 2018			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34495927-speak
