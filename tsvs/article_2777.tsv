History of the Peloponnesian War		Thucydides, Rex Warner, Moses I. Finley	3.89	27885	636	Written four hundred years before the birth of Christ, this detailed contemporary account of the long life-and-death struggle between Athens and Sparta stands an excellent chance of fulfilling its author's ambitious claim. Thucydides himself (c.460-400 BC) was an Athenian and achieved the rank of general in the earlier stages of the war. He applied thereafter a passion for accuracy and a contempt for myth and romance in compiling this factual record of a disastrous conflict.	648	-411		Greece Syracuse, Sicily	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/261243.History_of_the_Peloponnesian_War
