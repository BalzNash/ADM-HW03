Slaves of New York		Tama Janowitz	3.45	3641	145	"A coterie of artists, prostitutes, saints, and seers are all aspiring towards fame and hoping for love and acceptance. Instead they find high rents, faithless partners, and dead-end careers. Offbeat, funny and bitingly satirical, ""Slaves of New York"" sheds an incomparable light on the city's denizens and social mores."	278	1986		New York City, New York	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233504.Slaves_of_New_York
