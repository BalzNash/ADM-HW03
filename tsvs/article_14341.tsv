Where White Men Fear to Tread: The Autobiography of Russell Means		Russell Means, Marvin J. Wolf	4.12	1205	97	"Russell Means was the most controversial American Indian leader of our time. Where White Men Fear to Tread is the well-detailed, first-hand story of his life, in which he did everything possible to dramatize and justify the American Indian aim of self-determination, such as storming Mount Rushmore, seizing Plymouth Rock, running for President in 1988, and—most notoriously—leading a 71-day takeover of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973.This visionary autobiography by one of our most magnetic personalities will fascinate, educate, and inspire. As Dee Brown has written, ""A reading of Means's story is essential for any clear understanding of American Indians during the last half of the twentieth century."""	624	October 1st 1995	Russell Means, Larry Flynt, Hank Adams, Struck by the Ree, Bill Janklow, Dennis Banks, Dick Wilson, James Abourezk, Clyde Bellecourt, Brooklyn Rivera	Porcupine Greenwood, Missouri Vallejo Wounded Knee Pine Ridge, South Dakota Los Angeles, California	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/187799.Where_White_Men_Fear_to_Tread
