The Myth of the Eternal Return or, Cosmos and History		Mircea Eliade, Willard R. Trask	4.24	2462	123	"This founding work of the history of religions, first published in English in 1954, secured the North American reputation of the Romanian emigre-scholar Mircea Eliade (1907-86). Making reference to an astonishing number of cultures &amp; drawing on scholarship published in no less than half a dozen European languages, Eliade's ""The Myth of the Eternal Return makes both intelligible &amp; compelling the religious expressions &amp; activities of a wide variety of archaic &amp; ""primitive"" religious cultures. While acknowledging that a return to the ""archaic"" is no longer possible, Eliade passionately insists on the value of understanding this view in order to enrich our contemporary imagination of what it is to be human."	195	1949			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28025.The_Myth_of_the_Eternal_Return_or_Cosmos_and_History
