The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle		Avi	3.83	79728	3338	An ocean voyage of unimaginable consequences... Not every thirteen-year-old girl is accused of murder, brought to trial, and found guilty. But I was just such a girl, and my story is worth relating even if it did happen years ago. Be warned, however: If strong ideas and action offend you, read no more. Find another companion to share your idle hours. For my part I intend to tell the truth as I lived it.	278	September 1st 1990	Charlotte Doyle	Rhode Island Liverpool, England Atlantic Ocean	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/310146.The_True_Confessions_of_Charlotte_Doyle
