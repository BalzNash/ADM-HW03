Beat to Quarters	Hornblower Saga: Chronological Order #6	C.S. Forester	4.28	9715	367	"June 1808, somewhere west of Nicaragua-a site suitable for spectacular sea battles. The Admiralty has ordered Captain Horatio Hornblower, now in command of the thirty-six-gun HMS Lydia, to form an alliance against the Spanish colonial government with an insane Spanish landowner; to find a water route across the Central American isthmus; and ""to take, sink, burn or destroy"" the fifty-gun Spanish ship of the line Natividad or face court-martial. A daunting enough set of orders-even if the happily married captain were not woefully distracted by the passenger he is obliged to take on in Panama: Lady Barbara Wellesley."	324	1937	Horatio Hornblower		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84730.Beat_to_Quarters
