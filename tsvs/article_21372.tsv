Blue of Noon		Georges Bataille, Harry Mathews, Ken Hollings	3.73	2021	120	Set against the backdrop of Europe’s slide into Fascism, this twentieth-century erotic classic takes the reader on a dark journey through the psyche of the pre-war French intelligentsia, torn between identification with the victims of history and the glamour of its victors. One of Bataille’s overtly political works, it explores the ambiguity of sex as a subversive force, bringing violence, power, and death together in a terrifying unity.	162	1935		Paris Barcelona, Catalonia Germany	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/152121.Blue_of_Noon
