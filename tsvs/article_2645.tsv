Pilgrim at Tinker Creek		Annie Dillard	4.08	22278	2155	An exhilarating meditation on nature and its seasonsâ€”a personal narrative highlighting one year's exploration on foot in the author's own neighborhood in Tinker Creek, Virginia. In the summer, Dillard stalks muskrats in the creek and contemplates wave mechanics; in the fall she watches a monarch butterfly migration and dreams of Arctic caribou. She tries to con a coot; she collects pond water and examines it under a microscope. She unties a snake skin, witnesses a flood, and plays 'King of the Meadow' with a field of grasshoppers.	288	1974			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12527.Pilgrim_at_Tinker_Creek
