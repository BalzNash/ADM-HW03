The Grapes of Wrath		John Steinbeck	3.97	754157	17332	Shocking and controversial when it was first published in 1939, Steinbeck's Pulitzer prize-winning epic remains his undisputed masterpiece. Set against the background of dust bowl Oklahoma and Californian migrant life, it tells of the Joad family, who, like thousands of others, are forced to travel West in search of the promised land. Their story is one of false hopes, thwarted desires and broken dreams, yet out of their suffering Steinbeck created a drama that is intensely human, yet majestic in its scale and moral vision; an eloquent tribute to the endurance and dignity of the human spirit.	476	April 14th 1939	Tom Joad, Rose of Sharon Joad Rivers, Ma Joad, Pa Joad, Uncle John Joad, Jim Casy, Al Joad, Ruthie Joad, Winfield Joad, Noah Joad, Grampa Joad, Granma Joad, Connie Rivers	Oklahoma California United States of America	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath
