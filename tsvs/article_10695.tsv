The Powerbook		Jeanette Winterson	3.65	4395	276	The PowerBook is twenty-first century fiction that uses past, present and future as shifting dimensions of a multiple reality. The story is simple. An e-writer called Ali or Alix will write to order anything you like, provided that you are prepared to enter the story as yourself and take the risk of leaving it as someone else. You can be the hero of your own life. You can have freedom just for one night. But there is a price to pay.	244	1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50653.The_Powerbook
