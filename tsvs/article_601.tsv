Anne of Avonlea	Anne of Green Gables #2	L.M. Montgomery	4.20	146281	5296	At sixteen, Anne is grown up...almost. Her gray eyes shine like evening stars, but her red hair is still as peppery as her temper. In the years since she arrived at Green Gables as a freckle-faced orphan, she has earned the love of the people of Avonlea and a reputation for getting into scrapes. But when Anne begins her job as the new schoolteacher, the real test of her character begins. Along with teaching the three Rs, she is learning how complicated life can be when she meddles in someone else's romance, finds two new orphans at Green Gables, and wonders about the strange behaviour of the very handsome Gilbert Blythe. As Anne enters womanhood, her adventures touch the heart and the funny bone.	304	January 14th 1909	Marilla Cuthbert, Diana Barry, Gilbert Blythe, Rachel Lynde, Anne Shirley, Davy Keith, Dora Keith, Paul Irving, Stephen Irving, Lavender Lewis, J.
