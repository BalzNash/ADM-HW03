Wise Children		Angela Carter	3.93	7530	639	Dora and Nora Chance are a famous song-and-dance team of the British music halls. Billed as The Lucky Chances, the sisters are the illegitimate and unacknowledged daughters of Sir Melchior Hazard, the greatest Shakespearean actor of his day. At once ribald and sentimental, glittery and tender, this rambunctious family saga is Angela Carter at her bewitching best.	240	June 13th 1991			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/721867.Wise_Children
