Best Friends	Real Friends #2	Shannon Hale, LeUyen Pham	4.36	6967	712	"Sequel to Shannon Hale's award-winning graphic novel memoir, ""Real Friends"", this new graphic memoir picks up where ""Real Friends"" left off. As Shannon grows a little older, the rules of friendship always seem to be changing, leaving her guessing and trying her best to just keep up. ""Best Friends"" shares its predecessor's frankness, compassion, and enthralling, heartfelt visual storytelling. Junior high, as it turns out, is quite the roller coaster."					https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42346392-best-friends
