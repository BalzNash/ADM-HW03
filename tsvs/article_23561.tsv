The war has ended, and Clarence Miller carries wounds that cannot be seen. He returns home to a loving wife and infant son, but his life will never be the same again.Together they seek a fresh start in the country, but memories of his trauma near the Northern French village of Fromelles still imprison him. Tragedy strikes and casts a heavy shadow over ensuing generations of the Miller family. A voice from the past and a resolute young woman may be the family's only chance of finding peace.	396	September 2018 by			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41948764-beneath-the-willow
