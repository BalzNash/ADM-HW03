The Sentinel	The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke #2	Arthur C. Clarke	3.96	4672	176	Few masters of science fiction have brought us glimpses of the near future as vividly as Arthur C. Clarke. It is the startling realism of his vision that has made classics of his novels, such as CHILDHOOD'S END and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. It has also made Clarke himself one of the genre's most successful writers. The trade paperback was published to commemorate the arrival of the year 2001, one of the most notable dates in science fiction history. THE SENTINEL is a brilliant collection of Clarke's highest calibre short fiction.	304	1983			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/149070.The_Sentinel
