Darkmans	Thames Gateway #3	Nicola Barker	3.64	2085	280	If history is just a sick joke, then who exactly is telling it and why? Could it be John Scogin, Edward IV's court jester, whose favourite pastime was to burn people alive? Or is it Andrew Boarde, Henry VIII's physician, who kindly wrote Scogin's biography? This is a modern tale about two familiar subjects - love and jealousy.	838	January 1st 2007			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1139452.Darkmans
