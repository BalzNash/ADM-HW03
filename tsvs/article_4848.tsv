They're just trying to carve out a little (secret) time together, but no such luck.Disturbing things are happening at Fieldridge High, yet nobody's talking. When Janie taps into a classmate's violent nightmares, the case finally breaks open -- but nothing goes as planned. Not even close. Janie's in way over her head, and Cabe's shocking behavior has grave consequences for them both.Worse yet, Janie learns the truth about herself and her ability -- and it's bleak. Seriously, brutally bleak. Not only is her fate as a dream catcher sealed, but what's to come is way darker than she'd feared....From the inside of ISBN 1416953582/9781416953586	248	February 10th 2009	Janie Hannagan, Cabel Strumheller, Captain Fran Komisky, Martha Stubin	Michigan	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3657138-fade
