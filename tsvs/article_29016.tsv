Origins: Fourteen Billion Years of Cosmic Evolution		Neil deGrasse Tyson	4.15	7931	540	"""An accessible and extremely well-written exploration of the deep waters of cosmology, astrophysics, and exobiology.""--Kirkus ReviewsOur true origins are not just human, or even terrestrial, but in fact cosmic. Drawing on recent scientific breakthroughs and the current cross-pollination among geology, biology, astrophysics, and cosmology, Origins explains the soul-stirring leaps in our understanding of the cosmos. From the first image of a galaxy birth to Spirit Rover's exploration of Mars, to the discovery of water on one of Jupiter's moons, coauthors Neil deGrasse Tyson and Donald Goldsmith conduct a galvanizing tour of the cosmos with clarity and exuberance."	9	September 28th 2004			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20663771-origins
