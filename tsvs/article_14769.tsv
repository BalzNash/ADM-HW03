Where Angels Fear to Tread		E.M. Forster	3.62	13067	913	When the young English widow Lilia Herriton takes off on the grand tour and along the way marries a penniless Italian, her in-laws are far from amused. That the marriage should fail and poor Lilia die tragically are only to be expected. But that Lilia should have had a baby - and that the baby should be raised as an Italian! - are matters requiring immediate correction by Philip Herriton, his dour sister Harriet, and their well-meaning friend Miss Abbott.	148	1905	Philip Herriton, Mrs. Herriton, Harriet Purcell, Gino Carella, Caroline Abbott, Mrs. Theobold, Lilia Herriton, Irma Herriton		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3677.Where_Angels_Fear_to_Tread
