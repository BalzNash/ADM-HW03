The Parasites		Daphne du Maurier, Julie Myerson	3.70	1677	158	The backward glances at the careers of the young Delaneys reveal vistas of a vanishing Europe rich in colour and throbbing with old gaiety. The clash of the impulsive, artistic family with the calculating, aristocratic one is extremely well worked out. Above all, the three young Delaneys are characters one accepts as authentic.	352	1949			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18869975-the-parasites
