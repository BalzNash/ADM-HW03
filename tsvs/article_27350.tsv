in the absence of the sun		Emily Curtis	3.63	2044	219	"in the absence of the sun is a poetry collection that explores our midnight thoughts--the ""nightmares"" and ""dreams"" that haunt us when we are unable to sleep. This collection takes you through a night of insomnia, ruminating on ideas of self-doubt, loss, and hope for the future."	116	June 15th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35521162-in-the-absence-of-the-sun
