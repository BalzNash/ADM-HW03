Charade		Sandra Brown	3.95	8156	366	"A medical miracle gave TV personality Cat Delaney more than a new heart. It gave her a second chance at life. After leaving Hollywood to host a San Antonio TV show spotlighting children with special needs, Cat fights to gain respect as a newscaster. She meets Alex Pierce, an ex-cop turned crime writer, who regards her as a woman, not as a heart patient. When fatal ""accidents"" begin killing the other heart recipients, Alex may -or may not- be her most important ally. With her new world turning sinister and a mysterious stalker shadowing her every move, Cat is caught in a dark maze of betrayal and secrets...and perhaps sees too late the mask hiding a killer's face."	496	January 1st 1994	Cat Delaney, Alex Pierce	San Antonio, Texas	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30362.Charade
