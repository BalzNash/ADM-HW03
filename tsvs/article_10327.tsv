Chock-full of the familiar adventures of Spaceman Spiff, findings of Dad's popularity poll, and time travel to the Jurassic Age, Scientific Progress Goes ""Boink"" is guaranteed to set scientific inquiry back an eonâ€”and advance the reading pleasure of all Calvin and Hobbes fans."	128	1991 by Andrews	Calvin, Hobbes		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70488.Scientific_Progress_Goes_Boink_
