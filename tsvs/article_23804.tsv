Future Sex		Emily Witt	3.41	2370	283	"A funny, fresh, and moving antidote to conventional attitudes about sex and the single womanEmily Witt is single and in her thirties. She has slept with most of her male friends. Most of her male friends have slept with most of her female friends. Sexual promiscuity is the norm. But up until a few years ago, she still envisioned her sexual experience ""eventually reaching a terminus, like a monorail gliding to a stop at Epcot Center."" Like many people, she imagined herself disembarking, finding herself face-to-face with another human being, ""and there we would remain in our permanent station in life: the future.""But, as we all know, things are more complicated than that. Love is rare and frequently unreciprocated. Sexual acquisitiveness is risky and can be hurtful. And generalizing about what women want or don't want or should want or should do seems to lead nowhere. Don't our temperaments, our hang-ups, and our histories define our lives as much as our gender?In Future Sex, Witt captures the experiences of going to bars alone, dating online, and hooking up with strangers. From her home in San Francisco, she decides to say yes to everything and to find her own path. She observes the subcultures she encounters with a wry sense of humor, capturing them in all of their strangeness, ridiculousness, and beauty. The result is an open-minded, honest account of the contemporary pursuit of connection and pleasure, and an inspiring new model of female sexuality--open, forgiving, and unafraid."	214	August 11th 2015			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22929486-future-sex
