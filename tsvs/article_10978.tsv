Lost Light	Harry Bosch #9	Michael Connelly	4.18	48339	1670	The vision has haunted him for four years--a young woman lying crumpled in death, her hand outstretched in silent supplication. Harry Bosch was taken off the Angella Benton murder case when the production assistant's death was linked with the violent theft of two million dollars from a movie set. Both files were never closed. Now retired from the L.A.P.D., Bosch is determined to find justice for Angella. Without a badge to open doors and strike fear into the guilty, he's on his own. And even in the face of an opponent more powerful and ruthless than any he's ever encountered, Bosch is not backing down.	416	April 1st 2003	"Hieronymus ""Harry"" Bosch, Eleanor Wish, Roy Lindell, Kizmin ""Kiz"" Rider, Lawton Cross, Linus Simonson, John Peoples, Maddie Bosch"	Los Angeles, California Las Vegas, New Mexico	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/126507.Lost_Light
