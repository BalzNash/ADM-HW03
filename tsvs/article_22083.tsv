The Informationist	Vanessa Michael Munroe #1	Taylor Stevens	3.78	10062	1546	"""Vanessa Michael Munroe deals in information--expensive information--working for corporations, heads of state, private clients, and anyone else who can pay for her unique brand of expertise. Born to missionary parents in lawless central Africa, Munroe took up with an infamous gunrunner and his mercenary crew when she was just fourteen. As his protégé, she earned the respect of the jungle's most dangerous men, cultivating her own reputation for years until something sent her running. After almost a decade building a new life and lucrative career from her home base in Dallas, she's never looked back. Until now."""	307	2011	Logan, Vanessa Michael Munroe, Katherine ”Kate” Breeden, Emily Burbank, Elizabeth Burbank, Miles Bradford, Kristof Berger, Mel Shore, Boniface Akambe, Nicolas, Teodoro, Don Felipe, Silvestre Mba, Salvatore, Fransisco Beyard, Pieter Willem, George Wheal, Timoteo Otoro Nchama, Richard Burbank	Malabo Douala Yaoundé Mbini Bata, Cameroon Frankfurt	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8582356-the-informationist
