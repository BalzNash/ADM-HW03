Coming Up Roses		Catherine Anderson	4.12	1641	127	Widow Kate Blakely knew nothing of love - but she knew plenty about unhappiness. She'd married young, hoping to put down roots in a safe haven, but her husband had shattered her naivet√©, and made her fear for her beloved daughter's safety until the day he died.When she first met her new neighbor, Zachariah McGovern, all she saw was danger. But Zach saw much more. He saw beauty, he saw tenderness. He knew he could rescue Kate Blakely from her past - if only she would let him. What Zach couldn't know, however, was the price that had to be paid to save the woman he loved.	385	1993	Kate Blakely, Zachariah McGovern	Oregon	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/696512.Coming_Up_Roses
