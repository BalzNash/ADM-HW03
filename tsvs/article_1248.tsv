The Scorpio Races		Maggie Stiefvater, Carina Jansson	4.07	99389	12964	It happens at the start of every November: the Scorpio Races. Riders attempt to keep hold of their water horses long enough to make it to the finish line. Some riders live. Others die.At age nineteen, Sean Kendrick is the returning champion. He is a young man of few words, and if he has any fears, he keeps them buried deep, where no one else can see them.Puck Connolly is different. She never meant to ride in the Scorpio Races. But fate hasn’t given her much of a chance. So she enters the competition — the first girl ever to do so. She is in no way prepared for what is going to happen.	409	September 18th 2011	Puck Connolly, Sean Kendrick, Finn Connolly, Gabe Connolly, Benjamin Malvern, Matthew Malvern, George Holly, Peg Gratton	Thisby	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10626594-the-scorpio-races
