Solipsist		Henry Rollins	3.96	1427	78	"""I saw the word Solipsist while reading the dictionary in 1993. I was livingin NYC at the time and the word defined how the city made me feel. I workedon this book in several cities all over the world until 1996. The writing isobsessive and claustrophobic. To be solipsistic is to totally realize the egoand the nightmare of utter self-possession. I went for it and it swallowed mewhole."" --Henry Rollins"	160	August 10th 1998			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/503490.Solipsist
