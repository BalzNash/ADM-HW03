Peter Camenzind		Hermann Hesse, Michael E. Roloff	3.86	5786	299	Peter Camenzind, a young man from a Swiss mountain village, leaves his home and eagerly takes to the road in search of new experience. Traveling through Italy and France, Camenzind is increasingly disillusioned by the suffering he discovers around him; after failed romances and a tragic friendship, his idealism fades into crushing hopelessness. He finds peace again only when he cares for Boppi, an invalid who renews Camenzind's love for humanity and inspires him once again to find joy in the smallest details of every life.	208	1904	Peter Camenzind, Konrad Camenzind, Erminia Aglietti, RÃ¶si Girtanner, Elizabeth, Richard, Annunziata Nardini, Boppi, Mr. Camenzind Senior	Nimikon Zurich Milan Florence Umbria Paris Basel Assisi	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/71943.Peter_Camenzind
