Hunted Past Reason		Richard Matheson	3.11	893	124	It was supposed to be just an ordinary camping trip, two old friends hiking through the wilderness toward a remote cabin in the woods of northern California.But the enforced isolation of the hike soon exposes long-hidden rivalries and resentments between the two men. The deeper they get into the primeval wilderness and the farther from civilization, the greater the tension between them becomes—until the simmering hostility erupts into a terrifying life-or-death battle for survival!	304	2002	Bob Hansen, Doug	California	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219545.Hunted_Past_Reason
