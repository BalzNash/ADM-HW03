If I Break	If I Break #1	Portia Moore	4.11	12167	1095	When I met Cal Scott, I knew he’d be a distraction.At six-foot-two, with ebony hair, deep gray eyes, and a smile that could only hide an agenda, I knew he was trouble. And for the first time in my life, a little trouble was just what I needed.No. What I wanted.It wasn’t like I’d ever marry the guy.Until I did.What I thought would be my happily ever after, was only the beginning. Cal has a secret. One that makes loving him come with a price, and being his wife cost more than I bargained for.	309	June 4th 2014		Chicago, Illinois	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22172410-if-i-break
