A Short History of the Girl Next Door		Jared Reck	3.90	4866	1009	The unrequited love of the girl next door is the centerpiece of this fiercely funny, yet heart-breaking debut novel.Fifteen-year-old Matt Wainwright is in turmoil. He can’t tell his lifelong best friend, Tabby, how he really feels about her; his promising basketball skills are being overshadowed by his attitude on the court, and the only place he feels normal is in English class, where he can express his inner thoughts in quirky poems and essays. Matt is desperately hoping that Tabby will reciprocate his feelings; but then Tabby starts dating Liam Branson, senior basketball star and all-around great guy. Losing Tabby to Branson is bad enough; but, as Matt soon discovers, he’s close to losing everything that matters most to him.	272	September 26th 2017			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30040068-a-short-history-of-the-girl-next-door
