Trains and Buttered Toast		John Betjeman	3.68	107	15	Eccentric, sentimental &amp; homespun, John Betjeman's passions were mostly self-taught. He saw his country being devastated by war &amp; progress &amp; he waged a private war to save it. His only weapons were words - the poetry for which he is best known &amp;, even more influential, the radio talks that first made him a phenomenon.	342	June 1st 2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1345107.Trains_and_Buttered_Toast
