Waterland		Graham Swift	3.92	7613	586	Set in the bleak Fen Country of East Anglia, and spanning some 240 years in the lives of its haunted narrator and his ancestors, Waterland is a book that takes in eels and incest, ale-making and madness, the heartless sweep of history and a family romance as tormented as any in Greek tragedy.	368	1983			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/148639.Waterland
