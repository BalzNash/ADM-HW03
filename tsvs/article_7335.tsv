The Edible Woman		Margaret Atwood	3.68	29883	1735	Marian is determined to be ordinary. She lays her head gently on the shoulder of her serious fiancé and quietly awaits marriage. But she didn't count on an inner rebellion that would rock her stable routine, and her digestion. Marriage à la mode, Marian discovers, is something she literally can't stomach... The Edible Woman is a funny, engaging novel about emotional cannibalism, men and women, and the desire to be consumed.	310	December 31st 1969	Marian McAlpin, Ainsley Tewce, Peter Wollander	Toronto, Ontario	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/133445.The_Edible_Woman
