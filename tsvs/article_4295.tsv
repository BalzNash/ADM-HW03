Falls the Shadow	Welsh Princes #2	Sharon Kay Penman	4.40	9028	409	This is Simon de Montfort's storyâ€”and the story of King Henry III, as weak and changeable as Montfort was brash and unbending. It is a saga of two opposing wills that would later clash in a storm of violence and betrayal, a story straight from the pages of history that brings the world of the thirteenth century completely, provocatively, and magnificently alive. Above all, this is a story of conflict and treachery, of human frailty and broken legends, a tale of pageantry and grandeur that is as unforgettable as it is real....	580	April 1st 1988	Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester, Henry III of England, Llywelyn the Last, Davydd ap Gruffydd, Llewellyn ap Gruffydd, Nell de Montfort	Leicester, England North Wales	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/77448.Falls_the_Shadow
