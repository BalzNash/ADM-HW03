Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas		Hunter S. Thompson, Ralph Steadman	4.08	300231	6473	Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is the best chronicle of drug-soaked, addle-brained, rollicking good times ever committed to the printed page. It is also the tale of a long weekend road trip that has gone down in the annals of American pop culture as one of the strangest journeys ever undertaken.	204	July 7th 1971	Hunter S. Thompson	Las Vegas, Nevada Nevada	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7745.Fear_and_Loathing_in_Las_Vegas
