But hoping has gotten me in trouble before.DakotaThe absolute last girl I want to see in my court-ordered alcohol and drug information school, the girl who landed me here in the first place, walks in. After we hooked up, I thought I'd gotten Morgan out of my system. So why is my pulse racing? I can't afford to screw up right now. I know I should avoid her. Morgan has a way of messing up my life. But she's the only one who understands.	221	October 1st 2014			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23285789-crushed
