The Water Dancer		Ta-Nehisi Coates	4.07	66047	7913	Young Hiram Walker was born into bondage. When his mother was sold away, Hiram was robbed of all memory of her — but was gifted with a mysterious power. Years later, when Hiram almost drowns in a river, that same power saves his life. This brush with death births an urgency in Hiram and a daring scheme: to escape from the only home he’s ever known.So begins an unexpected journey that takes Hiram from the corrupt grandeur of Virginia’s proud plantations to desperate guerrilla cells in the wilderness, from the coffin of the deep South to dangerously utopic movements in the North. Even as he’s enlisted in the underground war between slavers and the enslaved, Hiram’s resolve to rescue the family he left behind endures.	403	September 24th 2019	Hiram Walker, Corrine Quinn, Thena, Sophia, Micajah Bland	Virginia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43982054-the-water-dancer
