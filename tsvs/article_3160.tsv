The End of Faith: Religion, Terror, and the Future of Reason		Sam Harris	3.90	35892	1706	In The End of Faith, Sam Harris delivers a startling analysis of the clash between reason and religion in the modern world. He offers a vivid, historical tour of our willingness to suspend reason in favor of religious beliefsâ€”even when these beliefs inspire the worst human atrocities. While warning against the encroachment of organized religion into world politics, Harris draws on insights from neuroscience, philosophy, and Eastern mysticism to deliver a call for a truly modern foundation for ethics and spirituality that is both secular and humanistic.Winner of the 2005 PEN/Martha Albrand Award for Nonfiction.	348	2004	Condoleezza Rice, Noam Chomsky, Christopher Hitchens, Fareed Zakaria		https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29501.The_End_of_Faith
