Waking the Moon		Elizabeth Hand	3.85	2039	202	Like all new students, Sweeney moves with caution at Washington, D.C.'s University of the Archangel and St. John the Divine. It is a strange place of brooding shrines and gleaming towers, guarded by stone angels. For Sweeney, college is a time to experiment with sex, to explore new friendships. It is a time of freedom and discovery--until she makes the wrong discovery.	497	1994			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102885.Waking_the_Moon
