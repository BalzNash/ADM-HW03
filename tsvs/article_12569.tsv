We All Looked Up		Tommy Wallach	3.58	19224	3031	Before the asteroid we let ourselves be defined by labels:The athlete, the outcast, the slacker, the overachiever. But then we all looked up and everything changed. They said it would be here in two months. That gave us two months to leave our labels behind. Two months to become something bigger than what we'd been, something that would last even after the end. Two months to really live.	370	March 24th 2015	Anita, Peter, Eliza, Andy	Seattle, Washington	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18392459-we-all-looked-up
