A tough-talking former cop, private investigator Kinsey Millhone has set up a modest detective agency in a quiet corner of Santa Teresa, California. She's a twice-divorced loner with few personal possessions and fewer personal attachments but with a soft spot for underdogs and lost causes.A IS FOR ACCUSED. That's why she draws desperate clients like Nikki Fife. Eight years ago, she was convicted of killing her philandering husband. Now she's out on parole and needs Kinsey's help to find the real killer. But after all this time, clearing Nikki's bad name won't be easy.A IS FOR ALIBI. If there's one thing that makes Kinsey Millhone feel alive, it's playing on the edge. When her investigation turns up a second corpse, more suspects, and a new reason to kill, Kinsey discovers that the edge is closer--and sharper--than she imagined.The titles in this extraordinary series are:""A"" Is for Alibi""B"" Is for Burglar""C"" Is for Corpse""D"" Is for Deadbeat""E"" Is for Evidence""F"" Is for Fugitive""G"" Is for Gumshoe""H"" Is for Homicide""I"" Is for Innocent""J"" Is for Judgment""K"" Is for Killer""L"" is for Lawless""M"" Is for Malice""N"" Is for Noose""O"" Is for Outlaw""P"" Is for Peril ""Q"" Is for Quarry""R"" Is for Ricochet ""S"" Is for Silence ""T"" Is for Trespass""U"" Is for Undertow ""V"" Is for Vengeance ""W"" Is for Wasted ""X""  “Y” Is for YesterdayThe letter Z was unfinished at the time of the author's death 12/28/2017"	308	April 15th 1982	Kinsey Millhone, Charlie Scorsoni (A is for Alibi), Laurence Fife (A is for Alibi), Nikki Fife, Gwen Jones, Rosie, Lieutenant Con Dolan, Libby Glass, Sharon Napier, Henry Pitts, Colin Fife, Gregory Fife, Diane Fife, Charlotte Mercer, Garry Steinberg	Santa Teresa, California Los Angeles, California Las Vegas, Nevada	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64863.A_is_for_Alibi
