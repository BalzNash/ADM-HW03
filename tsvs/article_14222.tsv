The Denial of Death		Ernest Becker, Sam Keen, Daniel Goleman	4.15	8321	850	"Winner of the Pulitzer prize in 1974 and the culmination of a life's work, The Denial of Death is Ernest Becker's brilliant and impassioned answer to the ""why"" of human existence. In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie -- man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than twenty years after its writing."	336	1973			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2761.The_Denial_of_Death
