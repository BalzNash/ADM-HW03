Twisted	Tangled #2	Emma Chase	4.02	30249	2780	There are two kinds of people in the world. The ones who look first, and the ones who leap. I’ve always been more of a looker. Cautious. A planner. That changed after I met Drew Evans. He was so persistent. So sure of himself – and of me.But not all love stories end happily ever after. Did you think Drew and I were going to ride off into the sunset? Join the club. Now I have to make a choice, the most important of my life. Drew already made his –in fact, he tried to decide for the both of us. But you know that’s just not my style. So I came back to Greenville. Alone. Well, sort of alone....What I've come to realize is that old habits die hard and sometimes you have to go back to where you began, before you can move ahead.TWISTED picks up two years after Tangled’s end, and is told from Kate’s POV.	272	March 25th 2014	Kate Brooks, Drew Evans	New York State Ohio	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17977710-twisted
