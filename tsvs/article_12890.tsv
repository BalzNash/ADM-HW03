In the Dream House		Carmen Maria Machado	4.52	26568	4008	For years Carmen Maria Machado has struggled to articulate her experiences in an abusive same-sex relationship. In this extraordinarily candid and radically inventive memoir, Machado tackles a dark and difficult subject with wit, inventiveness and an inquiring spirit, as she uses a series of narrative tropes—including classic horror themes—to create an entirely unique piece of work which is destined to become an instant classic.	251	November 5th 2019			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43317482-in-the-dream-house
