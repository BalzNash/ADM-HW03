True Grit		Charles Portis	4.13	44840	5447	"In the 1870s, young Mattie Ross learns that her beloved father was gunned down by his former handyman. But even though this gutsy 14-year-old is seeking vengeance, she is smart enough to figure out she can't go alone after a desperado who's holed up in Indian territory. With some fast-talking, she convinces mean, one-eyed US Marshal ""Rooster"" Cogburn into going after the despicable outlaw with her."	224	May 21st 1968	Mattie Ross, Tom Chaney, Rooster Cogburn, Ned Pepper	Fort Smith, Arkansas Indian Territory Oklahoma	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/257845.True_Grit
