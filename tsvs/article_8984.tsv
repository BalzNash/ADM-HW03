Mr Palomar		Italo Calvino, William Weaver	3.90	5787	409	Mr Palomar is a delightful eccentric whose chief activity is looking at things. He is simply seeking knowledge; 'it is only after you have come to know the surface of things that you can venture to seek what is underneath'. Whether contemplating a fine cheese, a hungry gecko, a woman sunbathing topless or a flight of migrant starlings, Mr Palomar's observations render the world afresh.	118	November 1983			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60106.Mr_Palomar
