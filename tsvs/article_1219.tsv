River God	Ancient Egypt #1	Wilbur Smith	4.20	34383	1506	For Tanus, the fair-haired young lion of a warrior, the gods have decreed that he will lead Egypt's army in a bold attempt to reunite the Kingdom's shared halves. But Tanus will have to defy the same gods to attain the reward they have forbidden him, an object more prized than battle's glory: possession of the Lady Lostris, a rare beauty with skin the color of oiled ceder--destined for the adoration of a nation, and the love of one extraordinary man.	664	1993	Taita, Tanus, Lostris, Menom, Kratas	Egypt	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/429138.River_God
