She had looks to die for, a handsome police-officer husband, and a carefree life in Key West. When she learned she was pregnant with their first child, her happiness was almost overwhelming. But Nina's world is shattered when she unearths a terrible secret that causes her to run for her life and change her identity.The perfect way to dieNow, years later, Nina risks everything she's earned to return to Florida and confront the murderous evil she fled.
