Doctor Glas		Hjalmar Söderberg, Paul Britten Austin, Margaret Atwood	3.82	7905	428	Stark, brooding, and enormously controversial when first published in 1905, this astonishing novel juxtaposes impressions of fin-de-siècle Stockholm against the psychological landscape of a man besieged by obsession. Lonely and introspective, Doctor Glas has long felt an instinctive hostility toward the odious local minister. So when the minister’s beautiful wife complains of her husband’s oppressive sexual attentions, Doctor Glas finds himself contemplating murder. A masterpiece of enduring power, Doctor Glas confronts a chilling moral quandary with gripping intensity.	156	1905	Gregorius, Tyko Gabriel Glas, Helga Gregorius	Stockholm	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/789497.Doctor_Glas
