Clown Girl		Monica Drake, Chuck Palahniuk	3.39	6180	344	Drake has created a novel that blends the high comedy of early film stars--most notably Chaplin and W.C. Fields--to raise questions of class, gender, economics, and prejudice. Resisting easy classification, this debut novel blends the bizarre, the humorous, and the gritty with great skill.	297	2006			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22286.Clown_Girl
