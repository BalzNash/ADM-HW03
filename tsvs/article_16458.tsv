She's been treating her friends Tommy and Annika to wild adventures, too--like buying and eating seventy-two pounds of candy, or sailing off to an island in the middle of a lake to see what it's like to be shipwrecked. But then Pippi's long lost father returns, and she might have to leave Villa Villekulla!From the Hans Christian Andersen Medal-winning author of the classic Pippi Longstocking,  this is another rollicking adventure that's sure to please fans of the freckled, fun-loving little girl.Lovers of Pippi Longstocking will welcome this rollicking tale of a topsy-turvy world in which Pippi and her next-door neighbors put into practice some ideas about good times. - School Library Journal	140	1946	Tommy Settergren, Pippi Långstrump, Annika Gannec	Sweden	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19308.Pippi_Goes_on_Board
