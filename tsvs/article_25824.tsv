Firedrake		Ann Ewan	4.38	32	2	"*Chosen for 2003 ""Our Choice"" Canadian Children's Centre literature guide*Shortlisted for the 2004 Snow Willow AwardAlthough Shan cannot see well and is barely an adult, she teams up with her unlikely companions - a madman (a handsome but rather depressed warrior) and a wizard (a well-intentioned but ineffective magician) - to destroy the Firedrake and free the Perinan people. Firedrake is in breadth, scope, and style one of the most ambitious and successful young adult fantasy novels yet written."	264	October 2002 by			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2241505.Firedrake
