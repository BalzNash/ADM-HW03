The Ladies of Missalonghi		Colleen McCullough	3.69	4019	446	Sometimes fairy tales can come true--even for plain, shy spinsters like Missy Wright. Neither as pretty as cousin Alicia nor as domineering as mother Drusilla, she seems doomed to a quiet life of near poverty at Missalonghi, her family's pitifully small homestead in Australia's Blue Mountains. But it's a brand new century--the twentieth--a time for new thoughts and bold new actions. And Missy Wright is about to set every self-righteous tongue in the town of Byron wagging. Because she has just set her sights on a mysterious, mistrusted, and unsuspecting stranger... who just might be Prince Charming in disguise.	189	1987	Una, Alicia Marshall, Lavinia (Augusta's daughter), John Smith (Colleen McCullough), Augusta, Buttercup, Antonia Wyndham, Wallace, Portia (McCullough), Marcia, Ted Marshall, Richard Hacket, Drusilla Hurlingford Wright, Octavia Hurlingford, Denys Hurlingford, Missy Wright, Maxwell Hurlingford, Livilla Hurlingford, Sir William Hurlingford, Aurelia Hurlingford Marshall, Thomas Hurlingford, Walter Hurlingford, Herbert Hurlingford, Septimus Hurlingford, Julia Hurlingford, Roger Hurlingford Witherspoon, Percival Hurlingford, Nikos Theodoropoulos, Eustace Wright, Old Man Wright, Montgomery Massey, Edmund Marshall, Randolph Marshall, Cornelia, William Hurlingford, Lady Billy, James Hurlingford, Dr. Neville Hurlingford, Mrs. Neville Hurlingford, Sir William Hurlingford the Third, Junia, Malcolm Hurlingford, Dr. George Parkinson, Anastasia Gilroy, Frank Pellagrino, Reverend Dr. Cecil Hurlingford, Mrs. Cecil Hurlingford, Quintus Hurlingford, Marcus Hurlingford	Missalonghi, Byron, New South Wales Byron, New South Wales Blue Mountains, New South Wales Katoomba, New South Wales Jamieson Valley, Blue Mountains, New South Wales Grose Valley, Blue Mountains, New South Wales Megalong Valley, Blue Mountains, New South Wales Caroline Lamb Place, Byron, New South Wales Central Station, Byron, New South Wales Gordon Road, Byron, New South Wales George Street, Byron, New South Wales Hurlingford Hotel, Byron, New South Wales Mon Repos, Byron, New South Wales Noel Street, Byron, New South Wales Nepean-Hawkesbury, New South Wales Balmoral Beach, Mosman, Sydney, New South Wales Castlereagh Street, Sydney, New South Wales Bridge Street, Sydney, New South Wales Hotel Metropole, Sydney, New South Wales Katoomba Street, Sydney, New South Wales Macquarie Street, Sydney, New South Wales Sydney, New South Wales	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/550343.The_Ladies_of_Missalonghi
