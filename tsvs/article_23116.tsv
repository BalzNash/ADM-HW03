The threat of execution is their recourse.Rejecting his role as an outcast, Brock risks his life and obtains a false rune, marking him a member of the Empire's ruling class. Under a veil of deception and backed by natural talent, the teen then schemes his way into a school where the Empireâ€™s future leaders are trained.Within the Academy, a legendary school of magic, science, politics, and combat, he uncovers secrets kept hidden for centuries - secrets that expose cracks in the foundation of Empire society. Among his discoveries is a long forgotten magic, powerful and dangerous - a magic he is determined to wield. Caught between his continued charade and a desire to tame his frightening new abilities, one misstep on either front could destroy him."	356	May 5th 2016		Issalia	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43735667-the-buried-symbol
