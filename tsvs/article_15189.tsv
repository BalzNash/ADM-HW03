Maid for Love	Gansett Island #1	Marie Force	3.99	23246	1540	Maddie Chester is determined to leave her hometown of Gansett Island, a place that has brought her only bad memories and ugly rumors. Then she’s knocked off her bike on the way to her housekeeping job at McCarthy’s Resort Hotel by Gansett’s “favorite son,” Mac McCarthy. He’s back in town to help his father with preparations to sell the family resort and has no intention of staying long. When Mac accidentally sends Maddie flying over the handlebars, badly injuring her, he moves in to nurse her back to health and help care for her young son. He soon realizes his plans for a hit-and-run visit to the island are in serious jeopardy, and he just may be “maid” for love.Gansett Island Reading OrderMaid for Love (Mac &amp; Maddie)Fool for Love (Joe &amp; Janey)Ready for Love (Luke &amp; Sydney)Falling for Love (Grant &amp; Stephanie)Hoping for Love (Evan &amp; Grace)Season for Love (Owen &amp; Laura)Longing for Love (Blaine &amp; Tiffany)Waiting for Love (Adam &amp; Abby)Time for Love (Daisy &amp; David)Meant for Love (Jenny &amp; Alex)Chance for Love, A Gansett Island Novella (Jared &amp; Lizzie)Gansett After Dark (Owen &amp; Laura)Kisses After Dark (Shane &amp; Katie)Love After Dark (Paul &amp; Hope)Celebration After Dark (Big Mac &amp; Linda)Desire After Dark (Slim &amp; Erin)Light After Dark (Mallory &amp; Quinn)Victoria &amp; Shannon (Episode 1)Kevin &amp; Chelsea (Episode 2)A Gansett Island Christmas NovellaMine After Dark (Riley &amp; Nikki)Yours After Dark (Finn &amp; Chloe)Trouble After Dark (Deacon &amp; Julia)Rescue After Dark (Mason &amp; Jordan)	236	April 28th 2011	"Madeline Chester, Malcolm ""Mac"" McCarthy, Janey McCarthy, Joe Cantrell"	Gansett Island	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43505148-maid-for-love
