DCYE: Mad Love		Lynessa Layne	5.00	1	0	When Kinsley walks away from Klive’s mind games, Jase welcomes her with open arms and takes her for a jog on the wild side he has been coaxing her toward. As ‘sweet Kins’ loses her inhibitions, Jase is thrilled, but Kinsley meets a side of herself she isn’t comfortable with. While Kinsley fights old enemies and provokes new ones who find a common hate, Klive steps off the sidelines to stand beside her in keeping them at bay, but Kinsley may find her worst enemy is the one she’s drawn the closest to.		2020			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55961601-dcye
