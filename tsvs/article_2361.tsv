The Robe		Lloyd C. Douglas	4.22	23196	1188	A Roman soldier, Marcellus, wins Christ's robe as a gambling prize. He then sets forth on a quest to find the truth about the Nazarene's robe-a quest that reaches to the very roots and heart of Christianity and is set against the vividly limned background of ancient Rome. Here is a timeless story of adventure, faith, and romance, a tale of spiritual longing and ultimate redemption.	528	October 1942	Demetrius, Marcellus	Iudeea Atena Roma Ierusalim Capernaum	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/219919.The_Robe
