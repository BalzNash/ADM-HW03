Boy: Tales of Childhood	Roald Dahl's Autobiography #1	Roald Dahl, Quentin Blake	4.07	57493	2793	In Boy, Roald Dahl recounts his days as a child growing up in England. From his years as a prankster at boarding school to his envious position as a chocolate tester for Cadbury's, Roald Dahl's boyhood was as full of excitement and the unexpected as are his world-famous, best-selling books. Packed with anecdotes—some funny, some painful, all interesting—this is a book that's sure to please.	176	1984			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6667.Boy
