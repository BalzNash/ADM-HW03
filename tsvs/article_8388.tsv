The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety		Alan W. Watts	4.20	15017	1017	In this fascinating book, Alan Watts explores man's quest for psychological security, examining our efforts to find spiritual and intellectual certainty in the realms of religion and philosophy. The Wisdom of Insecurity underlines the importance of our search for stability in an age where human life seems particularly vulnerable and uncertain. Watts argues our insecurity is the consequence of trying to be secure and that, ironically, salvation and sanity lie in the recognition that we have no way of saving ourselves.	152	1951			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/551520.The_Wisdom_of_Insecurity
