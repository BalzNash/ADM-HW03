A Hidden Fire	Elemental Mysteries #1	Elizabeth   Hunter	4.04	24906	1988	A phone call from an old friend sets Dr. Giovanni Vecchio back on the path of a mysterious manuscript he's hunted for over five hundred years. He never expected a young student librarian could be the key to unlock its secrets, nor could he have predicted the danger she would attract. Now he and Beatrice De Novo follow a twisted maze that leads from the archives of a university library, though the fires of Renaissance Florence, and toward a confrontation hundreds of years in the making.	398	October 13th 2011	Beatrice De Novo, Giovanni 'Gio' Vecchio, Carwyn ap Bryn, Tenzin	Houston, Texas	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24259392-a-hidden-fire
