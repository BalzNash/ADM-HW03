An overwhelming dose of boyfriend interference and a last-minute ticket to Boston later, and Jane's life is thrown off course.But Ryu’s best laid plans inevitably create more upheaval than even he can anticipate, and Jane winds up embroiled in an investigation involving a spree of gruesome killings committed by a being of tremendous power . . .. . . who, much to Jane’s surprise, happens to be another halfling.	350	June 16th 2010	Jane True, Anyan Barghest	Massachusetts	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7556058-tracking-the-tempest
