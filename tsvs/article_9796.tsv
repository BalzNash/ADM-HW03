Cider With Rosie	The Autobiographical Trilogy #1	Laurie Lee	3.94	9804	823	At all times wonderfully evocative and poignant, Cider With Rosie is a charming memoir of Laurie Lee's childhood in a remote Cotswold village, a world that is tangibly real and yet reminiscent of a now distant past.In this idyllic pastoral setting, unencumbered by the callous father who so quickly abandoned his family responsibilities, Laurie's adoring mother becomes the centre of his world as she struggles to raise a growing family against the backdrop of the Great War.The sophisticated adult author's retrospective commentary on events is endearingly juxtaposed with that of the innocent, spotty youth, permanently prone to tears and self-absorption.Rosie's identity from the novel Cider with Rosie was kept secret for 25 years. She was Rose Buckland, Lee's cousin by marriage.From the Paperback edition.	231	1959	Laurie Lee	Cotswolds, England Sheepscombe, Stroud, Gloucestershire, England Slad, Gloucestershire, England	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/292314.Cider_With_Rosie
