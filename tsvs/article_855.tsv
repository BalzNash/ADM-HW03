Factotum		Charles Bukowski	3.94	61724	1876	One of Bukowski's best, this beer-soaked, deliciously degenerate novel follows the wanderings of aspiring writer Henry Chinaski across World War II-era America. Deferred from military service, Chinaski travels from city to city, moving listlessly from one odd job to another, always needing money but never badly enough to keep a job. His day-to-day existence spirals into an endless litany of pathetic whores, sordid rooms, dreary embraces, and drunken brawls, as he makes his bitter, brilliant way from one drink to the next.Charles Bukowski's posthumous legend continues to grow. Factotum is a masterfully vivid evocation of slow-paced, low-life urbanity and alcoholism, and an excellent introduction to the fictional world of Charles Bukowski.	208	1975	Henry Chinaski	New Orleans, Louisiana Los Angeles, California New York City, New York Philadelphia, Pennsylvania St. Louis Miami, Florida Miami Beach, Florida	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/497199.Factotum
