A rousing tale of ""gratuitous shagging, murder, spanking, maiming, treason, and heretofore unexplored heights of vulgarity and profanity,"" Fool joins Moore's own Lamb, Fluke, The Stupidest Angel, and You Suck! as modern masterworks of satiric wit and sublimely twisted genius, prompting Carl Hiassen to declare Christopher Moore ""a very sick man, in the very best sense of the word."""	311	February 10th 2009	Regan, Pocket, Drool, Cordelia, Goneril, Leir of Britain	United Kingdom	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3684856-fool
