Moo		Jane Smiley	3.46	7665	652	"The hallowed halls of Moo University, a midwestern agricultural institution (aka ""cow college""), are rife with devious plots, mischievous intrigue, lusty liaisons, and academic one-upsmanship. In this wonderfully written and masterfully plotted novel, Jane Smiley, the prizewinning author of A Thousand Acres, offers a wickedly funny, darkly poignant comedy."	482	March 21st 1995			https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4605.Moo
